That includes pensioners saving an average £250 a year from concessionary travel or people with long term illnesses an average of £104 on prescription charges.
A vote for the SNP in May is a vote to protect these gains.
As well as certainty on Council Tax bills, we have also placed limits on increases in rail fares and water charges.
Through tough and effective regulation of Scottish Water we’ve been able to deliver realterms cuts in water bills.
In the same way we wish to see a more robust approach to energy bills and believe Ofgem should be empowered to enforce price reductions to reflect lower wholesale costs as a result of lower oil prices.
Consumers must see the benefit of lower wholesale costs in their bills, with savings of as much as £100 a year.
The Scottish Government and UK government should have joint oversight of Ofgem.
A fair deal for older Scots
We will continue to support older Scots, by retaining key policies such as the free bus pass and free personal care and we’ll back the continuation of the free TV license.
At Westminster, we will call for the pension triple lock to be retained, ensuring the State Pension increases each year in line with inflation, wages or by 2.5 per cent, whichever is higher.
And, we will support for a Single Tier Pension rate of £160 per week.
We will oppose the abolition of Savings Credit – introduced to reward people for saving for their pension.
We believe that there should be a review of plans to increase the state pension age beyond 66.
And, given Scotland’s colder climate, we will also resist any attempts to end the winter fuel allowance.
We will continue to support the roll out of auto enrolment for occupational pensions and also back, in principle, proposals to give pensioners more flexibility over their pension pots.
However, we must ensure adequate levels of advice and support.
We will work with pensioner groups to identify and target unfair, hidden pension charges.
Fairness in the welfare system
Westminster has presided over a relentless undermining of our social security system.
The SNP is determined to target the worst and most damaging welfare changes introduced by the current government
and to address issues such as zerohour contracts, which create unacceptable levels of uncertainty and financial insecurity for often low paid workers.
We will support efforts in the next parliament to end unfair and exploitative zerohour contracts,
with a timelimited consultation, which fully involves businesses and the trade unions, to agree the most effective way forward.
SNP MPs will vote for the complete abolition of the bedroom tax.
This will mean that the £35 million that the Scottish Government spends on mitigating its impact will be available for other purposes.
We would invest that money to tackle and eventually eradicate food poverty.
We also back increases of at least the cost of living in welfare benefits and believe the roll out of both Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit should be halted.
We will aim to reverse the replacement of Disability Living Allowance with PIP.
We will also oppose the £3 billion cut in disability support.
In addition, we have given assurances to people already supported by the Independent Living Fund that support will continue.
We will also support an urgent review of the system of assessments for disability benefits.
The current tapers for Universal Credit have been set too low, which means claimants will still be caught in the benefits trap, with clear financial disincentives in place for work.
We believe there should be an increase in the work allowance, to deliver a significant boost to the incomes of people moving into work, helping to lift them and their families out of poverty.
We will also support an overhaul of the Work Capability Assessments.
These are still delivering too many poor decisions, which are overturned on appeal, creating real hardship for households.
We will demand an urgent review of the conditionality and sanctions regime, in order to deliver an overhaul of the current, deeply ineffective arrangements, which impact on some of the most vulnerable in our society.
The review will take particular account of the needs of people with mental health issues.
We will seek to establish an approach that is proportionate and ethical, that recognises the particular challenges facing some individuals, and that avoids excessive or blanket measures which penalise those looking for work.
The removal of cash benefits should be a last, rather than a first, resort.
We will support an increase in Carers' Allowance so that it matches Jobseekers' Allowance.
Those in receipt of Carers' Allowance will benefit by almost £600 per year.
We will also press for the introduction, in Scotland, of a pilot programme of carer’s leave.
We will not support attempts to restrict housing benefit for 18 to 21 year olds and believe exemptions to the Shared Accommodation Rate should be extended, for example, to cover all ages.
We believe that those who have been injured in the service of our country should get the full value of any war disablement pension and so will ensure that it is not treated as income in the assessment of entitlement to other benefits.
Ending fuel poverty has also been a key campaign for the SNP at Westminster for decades.
In this next Parliament, we will seek action to ensure that those using prepayment meters have access to the same lower energy prices available to those using other payment methods.
We will also press the UK government to ensure that pensioners whose homes are ‘off grid’ receive their winter fuel allowances earlier, so they can take advantage of lower prices earlier in the year.
A STRONGER SOCIETY
This election is an opportunity for Scotland to have real influence to deliver important gains and protections.
On a wide range of issues, Scottish values and priorities can carry real weight at Westminster.
Working in partnership
We will press the UK government to work with the business community on mechanisms to formalise the relationship between government, employer associations and employee associations with a particular focus on encouraging wider trade union participation and recognising the positive role that can be played by collective bargaining in improving labour market conditions.
Evidence from the OECD shows that stronger trade unions tend to reduce inequality in labour income and ensure a more equal distribution of earnings.
We support increased employee representation on company boards, believing that this can help bolster longterm decisionmaking and improve industrial relations.
We will urge the UK government to consult on how best to deliver such an increase.
We will seek to reverse recent changes, which reduced key aspects of workers’ rights.
For example, we will press for the restoration of a 90 days consultation period for redundancies affecting 100 or more employees.
In addition, we will also oppose Tory plans to further restrict the right to strike
and support trade unions with their proposals to modernise the way strike ballots are undertaken, with safe and secure online voting to maximise participation.
Caring about climate change, our environment and the natural world
CARBON REDUCTION
We will use our influence at Westminster to ensure the UK matches, and supports, Scotland’s ambitious commitments to carbon reduction
and that both Scotland and the UK are able to play a constructive role at this year’s UN Climate Change Conference.
And, we will call on the UK government to match the approach of the Scottish Government with a dedicated Climate Justice Fund.
RENEWABLE & COMMUNITY ENERGY
We will seek to maximise support for offshore wind, including by seeking alterations to the current Contracts for Differences (CFD) regime to ensure that support is given to the offshore wind sector to not only generate renewable energy
but also to boost manufacturing opportunities and ensure Scotland sees maximum investment.
Allocations from the next round of CFD should be made early and projects in Scotland should be prioritised and receive their fair share of funding.
We want to see a longterm commitment to the development of this industry.
We will continue to argue for changes to ensure that Scottish renewables, and Scotland’s islands, are not penalised because of their distance from markets in the south of England.
We believe that transmission arrangements should work to support, rather than undermine, production of renewable energy in the most favourable locations.
And we will press for onshore wind to continue to receive support through the lifetime of the next Parliament.
Our ambition is not limited to wind.
We want the UK government to remove barriers that are limiting growth in the hydro sector
and believe there should be additional support for pump hydro and Carbon Capture and Storage schemes.
We also wish to see a big expansion in community heating schemes and believe the Renewable Heat Incentive should continue beyond 2015.
The Scottish Government has ambitious targets to support community energy generation and we will press the UK government to make it simpler for communities to establish local energy companies and easier for community schemes to access the grid.
SPECIES PROTECTION
While responsibility for animal welfare is devolved to the Scottish Parliament –and the SNP in government is already working to improve the conditions of kept animals, including consultations on responsible dog ownership
and wild animals in travelling circuses,
and giving consideration to further protection at slaughter,
the registration or licensing of horse establishments
and a review of tail docking in working dogs at Westminster
we will support further animal welfare measures with a global focus.
This includes action to end the illegal ivory trade and protect species such as polar bears and bluefin tuna.
Our place in the world
Scotland is an outward looking nation.
We have family in all parts of the world and our society has been strengthened, over generations, by new Scots arriving from across the globe.
This is part of who we are and provides untold benefits, socially, culturally and economically.
That is why we must do all we can to prevent increasingly insular attitudes at Westminster from shutting Scotland off from the world.
Backing the Scottish Government’s international strategy The Scottish Government’s international strategy is based on three core elements participation, promotion and protection and these will be central to our approach at Westminster.
We expect the UK government to participate fully in international institutions, to respect their role and to work with them.
This includes the UK fulfilling all its international obligations.
The UK’s standing in the world has been damaged by our involvement in the illegal war in Iraq.
We wish to see proper oversight and approval for any future UK military action, which would need to be in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter and approved by Parliament.
We will call on the next UK government to pursue a two state solution for Israel and Palestine and to support the formal recognition of a Palestinian state.
MAKING THE EU WORK BETTER FOR SCOTLAND
The European Union is far from perfect, however we believe that it is overwhelmingly in Scotland’s interests for us to remain a member,
engaging with the institutions as fully as we can, and to argue for reform from within.
We will oppose UK withdrawal from the EU and will propose that, in any future referendum there should be a double majority requirement.
Each of the four constituent nations of the UK would have to vote for withdrawal before the UK as a whole could leave the European Union.
We believe there should be a greater role for devolved administrations in the Council of Ministers and more direct engagement in devolved policy areas, across the full range of European institutions.
We will seek a Cooperation Agreement between the UK government and devolved administrations, which will include formal agreement on speaking rights for Scottish ministers and direct Scottish input into the development of UK policy on key EU issues.
We support free movement within the EU and recognise both the contribution EU citizens make to Scottish society and the opportunities created for Scottish citizens elsewhere in the EU.
We also support Scottish participation in the European Arrest warrant, a measure that makes it easier to bring to justice criminals who have fled to other EU jurisdictions.
We will also seek an explicit exemption for the NHS and Scottish Water, as part of a general public sector exemption, from the terms of the proposed TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
A FOCUS ON INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE AND PEACE
Today, Scottish international aid investment is making a big difference to thousands of lives in some of the world’s most disadvantaged communities.
We have long supported the United Nations target to spend 0.7 per cent of Gross National Income (GNI) on international development and will continue to support UK spending at this level
– which must be calculated on current, not former, measurements of GNI.
As part of a commitment to focus on aid quality, we believe that overseas aid funding should not be used for defence related expenditure
and should not undermine public services in developing countries.
And, we are in favour of an audit of outstanding debt owed by developing countries, with debt relief provided as appropriate.
SNP MPs will also make the case for the establishment of a special envoy a diplomatic post within the Foreign Office to promote the rights of LGBTI people throughout the word, as an integral part of UK foreign policy.
Defence that works for the people of Scotland
STRATEGIC DEFENCE AND SECURITY REVIEW
As a northern European nation, our near neighbourhood including the High North and Arctic are a key priority for Scotland.
The forthcoming UK Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) must take full account of the particular challenges and opportunities of the northern regional dimension,
and of the need to be more effective at combatting cyberterrorism where the SDSR must lay out a clear strategy,
including continued engagement with the Scottish Government.
The SDSR must review the current Ministry of Defence record, which includes falsely inflating spending commitments, mismanaging Army personnel reforms and creating dangerous capability gaps.
In particular, we believe there should be ocean going conventional patrol vessels based permanently in Scotland
and will seek the early procurement of multirole Maritime Patrol Aircraft purchased ‘off the shelf’ by the end of this parliament and operating from Scotland.
The SDSR must also fully consider the advantages of a defence policy without weapons of mass destruction and wasting £100bn renewing Trident.
We will continue in our principled opposition to nuclear weapons and believe that the UK should abandon plans to renew the Trident nuclear missile system.
In addition, the MoD should also publish in full current and projected annual costs of the Trident system and its proposed successor programme, including nuclear weapons throughlife costs.
THE CONVENTIONAL DEFENCE FOOTPRINT
UK policy has seen reductions in conventional footprint in Scotland, leading to a significant underspend, meaning fewer jobs and less defence related spending to benefit local economies.
Existing conventional bases in Scotland should be retained and all conventional rebasing activities should be completed by the end of this parliament.
There should be no further erosion of the Scottish regiments
and it remains our ambition to see the traditional regiments restored.
DEFENCE SPENDING
We support greater transparency in UK defence spending, with a full breakdown of spending by nation and region in the UK, including all procurement and SME expenditure and a full breakdown of component costs of all major projects by location.
With taxpayers in Scotland contributing billions of pounds more than the MOD currently spends in Scotland we believe that a far larger proportion of the defence procurement budget should be spent in Scotland.
There should be a strategy developed by the MOD to ensure more small and medium sized enterprises in Scotland are part of the manufacturing support chain for major defence projects.
The Type 26 frigates must be built in Scotland and the Aircraft Carriers refitted at Rosyth.
LOOKING AFTER OUR SERVICE PERSONNEL
The duty of care to our service personnel, veterans and their families must be a key priority.
The MoD should provide much better support to next of kin and bereaved families in the event of a loss of a serving relative.
As a matter of safety, we believe a collision warning system should be installed on Tornado and Typhoon aircraft as quickly as possible.
We also support giving Armed Forces representative bodies a statutory footing.
New powers to protect our communities
There is no doubt that Fixed Odds Betting Terminals cause harm and hardship in communities across Scotland.
That’s why the Scottish Government needs legislative powers to control the growth and impact of these machines,
and we believe the UK government should devolve these powers in full.
The problem of Fixed Odds Betting Terminals is linked to the proliferation of betting shops in some communities and so we will continue to argue for Scotland to have full responsibility for the regulation of gambling.
We will also seek new powers so we can effectively regulate payday lenders in Scotland’s communities, building on the recommendations of the Smith Commission and going beyond proposals set out so far by the current UK government.
Protecting personal data
We do not support Tory plans for the reintroduction of the so called ‘snoopers’ charter’, which would see all online activity of every person in the UK stored for a year.
Instead, we need a proportionate response to extremism.
That is why we will support targeted, and properly overseen, measures to identify suspected extremists and, if necessary, examine their online activity and communications.
A flourishing media environment and creative sector
We believe that responsibility for broadcasting in Scotland should transfer from Westminster to the Scottish Parliament and we will support moves to more devolved arrangements for the BBC with greater powers and funding for the different national and regional broadcasting areas, such as BBC Scotland.
We believe that the licence fee should be retained with any replacement system,
which should be based primarily on the ability to pay, in place by the end of the next BBC Charter period.
BBC Scotland should receive a fairer share of BBC income, reflecting more accurately the licence fee revenue raised here in Scotland.
This would provide a boost of over £100 million, which we believe will provide important new opportunities for production companies and the creative sector in Scotland.
The Scottish Government and Parliament should have a substantial role at all stages in the review of the BBC Charter and we will work to ensure that any new governance arrangements for the BBC better reflect Scotland’s interests.
It should also be for the Scottish Government to decide which sporting events in Scotland should be included in the list of those that are free to view in Scotland.
Regulation of print media is already devolved.
The Scottish Parliament chose, on a cross party basis, to support the UK Government’s actions to implement Leveson.
We will consider carefully the results of the first year review and work with other parties, in Scotland and at Westminster, to ensure effective regulation of the media on a nonpolitical basis.
Safeguarding our land and seas
We will press the UK government to reinstate an emergency towing vehicle on the west coast of Scotland and to ensure that delays in recruitment don’t leave vital coastguard stations understaffed.
We will seek a commitment for the earliest possible return of the Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre to Kinloss, so that search and rescue operations can be coordinated in Scotland.
SORTING THE BROKEN WESTMINSTER SYSTEM
This election gives us a rare opportunity to begin to repair what is an increasingly broken political system in the UK.
We need to make clear to those who wield power that they do so only with the consent of the people.
Almost every aspect of the system needs an overhaul.
That includes an effective power of recall for MPs.
We will continue to work with others, across the political parties, to deliver a system that gives real power to voters to remove MPs who have forfeited the trust of their electors.
We also badly need a fair voting system for UK elections.
The electoral system means political focus is on the interests of a small number of swing voters in marginal seats, and that has meant the economic and social needs of areas like the north of England, Scotland, the West Midlands and Wales have been forgotten.
The SNP supports the Single Transferable Vote, a system that makes sure every vote and every part of the country counts.
Of course, the second chamber of the UK parliament is not even elected and continues to have hereditary members who have a greater say in the future of Scotland’s defence or welfare system than the elected members of the Scottish Parliament.
The SNP believes the House of Lords should be scrapped and replaced with a fully elected second chamber.
Given the successful inclusion of 16 and 17 year olds in the independence vote the Scottish Parliament is legislating to ensure they also have the vote in Holyrood elections.
We believe 16 and 17 year olds should be given the vote in UK general and European elections and will work with future governments to secure this change
Lobbying and charities
We  support  strict  rules  on  lobbying  but  believe  that campaigning  charities  should  be  allowed  straightforward  access  and  restrictions  on  their  activities  as ‘nonparty  campaigners’  should  be  removed.
Promoting equality and protecting human rights
Scotland’s new First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon MSP, has given a very clear signal of the need to have more equal representation of men and women in public life.
The Scottish Cabinet is one of only three cabinets in the developed world to have an equal number of men and women
and, with the necessary powers devolved, we will take forward proposals to ensure 50 per cent female representation on public boards.
We will press for the same step to be taken for UK wide public bodies and will also encourage the new UK government to work with the private sector to increase the number of women represented at the most senior levels in our major companies.
We will support the tightening of the law on maternity discrimination, with legislation introduced within the first year of a new UK government.
We have also called for early action on Equal Pay audits for larger companies to ensure women are getting the salaries they are entitled to.
We will demand that section 78 of the Equalities Act 2010 is commenced and that regulations to compel employers of more than 250 people to publish annual gender pay gap information, starting in 201617, are consulted on and brought into law.
VAT on sanitary products
We are determined to ensure a fairer deal for women, not only in the work place.
That’s why we’ll address a longstanding failure in our tax system by demanding that VAT on sanitary products is removed.
Sanitary products are a necessity, not a luxury, and should not be taxed.
With powers over equalities devolved, we would bring forward an Equal Pay (Scotland) Bill to finally deliver equal pay law that works for women in Scotland.
It is unacceptable 45 years after the Equal Pay Act was passed in 1970 that the gender pay gap remains.
This would include consultation on how new regulations or structures can be created by the Bill to expedite the equal pay claims process, and ensure that settlements are enforced quickly.
We will seek to maintain the protections provided by the Equality Act 2010 and will ask the government to engage with key stakeholders on potential improvements.
We will also support calls to establish a Race Committee to advise the work of the Equality and Human Rights Commission.
In addition, we will ask the UK government to conduct an early review of the current immigration detention system and regime, in order to deliver a fairer and more effective system as we move forward.
Given the central place of human rights in Scotland’s constitutional settlement, and their importance at the heart of our politics, we will oppose scrapping the Human Rights Act
or withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights.
BACKING THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT
Too often in recent years, decisions by governments at Westminster have undermined the ability of the Scottish Government to deliver as much as it would wish.
This has included budget cuts as a result of austerity, questionable application of the Barnett Formula and long delays in giving approval for Scottish Government proposals, for example the mechanism to mitigate the Bedroom Tax in Scotland.
A strong team of SNP MPs at Westminster can do more to ensure that the UK government is not standing in the way of progress for Scotland.
Protecting a strong record of delivery
At the heart of this manifesto is our commitment to move away from the damaging austerity agenda of the current UK government, so that we can protect Scotland’s public services from future Tory cuts and protect the progress that has been delivered by tens of thousands of dedicated public sector staff.
In health, with the SNP, the number of staff working in Scotland’s NHS has risen to a record high, with over 10,000 more people now working in the NHS.
These staff have delivered shorter waiting times, including in vitally important areas such as cancer treatment.
While there is still work to do, the number of people starting treatment for cancer within 62 days of referral has risen from 84.5 per cent in 2007 to 94.2 per cent.
Nearly twothirds of people in Scotland now say they are satisfied with our health service, according to the most recent survey, compared to just twofifths in 2005.
In our schools, against every main measure, education is getting better.
We have record exam results and record high number of school leavers in either work, training or further or higher education.
The number of P1 pupils in Scotland taught in classes of more than 25 has fallen to just 451 this year
– 97 per cent lower than the 16,845 children recorded in 2006.
And the proportion of schools reported as being in ‘good’ or ‘satisfactory’ condition has increased again, to 83 per cent – up from 61 per cent in April 2007.
That means the number of pupils in poor or bad buildings has more than halved since 2007.
Working for a healthier Scotland
Since the election of the SNP government in 2007: There has been an increase of over 2,300 nurses and midwives in Scotland and 2,350 doctors
More than 320 extra GPs work in our communities
and there are almost 1,350 more consultants providing specialist care in our NHS,
including a 170 per cent increase in A&E consultants
We’ve seen an 8.8 per cent increase in the number of paramedics
while the number of senior managers in the NHS is down 29 per cent.
We’ve  protected  NHS  spending  against Westminster  austerity  –  and  we  will  argue  for increases  in  health  spending  across  the  UK  of £9.5  billion  above  inflation  by  202021   £24 billion  in  total.
This  will  deliver  a  total  increase for  NHS  Scotland  of  £2  billion  by  202021.
And in our communities people are feeling safer.
The crime clear up rate is the highest since comparable records began in 1976 and recorded crime has fallen for the seventh year in a row and is now at its lowest level for 40 years.
We’ve also acted to tackle the scourge of knife crime.
The average prison sentence for handling an offensive weapon in Scotland is now three times higher than in 200405.
Crimes of handling an offensive weapon (including knives) have reduced by 62 per cent since 200607.
Education – an investment in all our futures
Under the SNP Government at Holyrood: Tuition fees have been scrapped – and more young people than ever before are going to university
We’ve introduced the new Curriculum for Excellence and invested in new school buildings so more of our children can enjoy the best possible learning environment
Pass rates for Higher exams have reached record levels, with children sitting the new National exams for the first time last year.
And we’ve launched a £100 million Attainment Scotland Fund to support primary school pupils in some of our most disadvantaged areas
There are 25,000 apprenticeships available every year – and we have pledged to increase this to 30,000 by 2020.
The biggest threat to this progress is another swathe of Westminster inspired austerity cuts, which could have a devastating impact on services across the country.
Over half of the total planned cuts are still to come over the course of the next UK Parliament.
If we don’t act now to end Tory austerity, Scotland’s cumulative share of the proposed realterms cuts over the next five years is estimated at around £12 billion £2300 for every person in Scotland.
That is why this election is so important, so we can choose a different path forward, which enables the SNP Scottish
Safer streets and safer communities
We’ve rejected the approach adopted elsewhere in the UK and chosen to maintain investment in 1,000 extra police, enabling Police Scotland to deliver record low crime rates:
Recorded crime in Scotland is at its lowest level in 40 years, and the number of homicides has halved since 2007.
The clearup rate for recorded crimes is at its highest since 1976, when comparable records began.
Reoffending rates have fallen over the last decade, with a 17 per cent drop in the average number of reconvictions per offender.
SNP MPs will press for the revenue from court fines to be retained in Scotland and for Police Scotland and our Fire and Rescue Service to receive the same VAT exemption as other forces,
with the money reinvested in safer communities.
Government to continue to deliver the high quality services people in Scotland expect.
And it is a path that will enable us to build on the continuing economic recovery.
Over the past 12 months around 46,000 more people are in work.
That includes, in recent months, a record high number of women in employment in Scotland.
And youth unemployment is at a five year low.
Two in every five business properties across Scotland benefit from zero or reduced rates through the Small Business Bonus Scheme alone, supporting local job creators, and the latest figures show inward investment at a 17year high.
Overall, our business rates relief packages benefit around 100,000 companies.
But there is much more we can achieve and SNP MPs in the House of Commons will work with SNP ministers in the Scottish Government to ensure that we continue to make progress as a society and economy, across all three of the Scottish Government’s priority areas:
Creating more, better paid jobs in a strong, sustainable economy
Our ambition is for a stronger Scottish economy, with the fruits of economic success shared more widely.
We have set out our plans to deliver higher levels of sustainable economic growth through the Scottish Government’s refreshed Economic Strategy.
This includes proposals to boost Scotland’s competitiveness, reduce levels of inequality and increase productivity.
Our aim is to match the productivity levels of the most successful economies in Europe.
We also want Scotland to be in the top quarter of OECD countries in terms of wellbeing, sustainability and equality.
This includes narrowing the economic gap between the different regions of Scotland.
We are focused on four key themes – Investment, Innovation, Inclusive Growth and Internationalisation.
We know that building a highskill, connected Scotland is essential if we are to maximise our nation’s economic potential.
That is why we are investing in our people, infrastructure and assets, for example, by working to widen access to higher education.
New skills provide a route into rewarding, fulfilling employment.
Our approach will see 30,000 new Modern Apprenticeship opportunities every year by 2020, having already exceeded our current target of 25,000 per year.
Our aim is to reduce youth unemployment by 40 percent by 2021.
We believe that the more we can integrate skills and employment policy, with an extension of powers for the Scottish Parliament,
the more we can achieve for people joining the jobs market.
That includes the prompt devolution of the Work Programme and Work Choice.
We will also keep university education in Scotland free
and have increased the minimum income for our poorest students to £7,500 this year.
We are also investing to support Scotland’s job creators.
Through initiatives like the Scottish Business Development Bank we want to find ways of improving access to finance for growing businesses
and we will use the influence we have at Westminster to secure additional funds so we can further increase support for Scottish companies.
We are determined to maintain Scotland's position as the best place to do business in the UK with a package of business rates relief worth an estimated £594 million for 201415
and £618 million for 201516
– supporting around 100,000 businesses across the country.
And we will continue to maximise investment in our nation’s infrastructure, using both capital spending, new borrowing powers and a range of innovative finance mechanisms.
In government, we have adopted an ‘allScotland’ approach, with key infrastructure projects across the country to ensure the fruits of economic opportunity are shared as widely as possible.
Projects include the A9, Aberdeen to Inverness rail line,
the Aberdeen bypass,
the Borders Railway,
the completion of the GlasgowEdinburgh rail improvements
and the Dundee Waterfront project.
In addition, we are supporting our construction sector by providing £30 million of ringfenced support for smaller developers within the Help to Buy Scotland scheme.
We will also invest £70 million over the next year in the Open Market Shared Equity Scheme to help first time buyers, with low or moderate incomes, on to the property ladder.
Our aim is to foster a culture of Innovation.
In government that means establishing a new Ministerial led Innovation Forum and supporting the network of Innovation Centres, so that we can ensure effective knowledge and innovation transfer from our academic research base into the wider business community.
This approach includes a £1 million Innovation Challenge Fund to help address major societal and industrial challenges.
We are supporting international collaboration by piloting Innovation and Investment Hubs at key global locations
and are also promoting innovation in, and through, the public sector as a means of getting the most out of public expenditure across the economy.
We recognise and applaud the vital part played by our universities in creating worldleading research, including in areas of cuttingedge science and technology,
and boosting both Scotland’s international profile and innovation base.
We will continue to work closely with our universities to maintain their position of global excellence.
Supporting Scottish business
We have been working hard to help Scottish business succeed, including: Delivering the most competitive business tax environment anywhere in the UK through our business rates policies//,
and the package of business rates reliefs worth an estimated £618 million in 201516.
Maintaining the Small Business Bonus Scheme which removes or reduces rates for almost 100,000 businesses.
We’re helping business get access to finance through the Scottish Loan Fund and the Scottish Investment Bank
and we are providing advisory support through Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Business Gateway to help companies improve their chances of securing funding.
Promoting a culture of entrepreneurial ambition and innovation in Scotland by supporting ambitious collaborations between universities, businesses and others to capitalise on Scotland’s worldclass research including through a network of eight Innovation Centres.
And, we’re working to encourage more Scottish companies to become active exporters with Scottish Development International working with partners to support up to 10,000 more businesses develop the skills to go international.
Our plans are centred on the idea of Inclusive Growth.
We want more people in Scotland to share in the fruits of economic growth.
We are determined to deliver improvements in educational outcomes in Scotland’s most disadvantaged communities, which is why we have announced our £100 million Attainment Scotland Fund.
By establishing a Fair Work Convention we aim to draw on and promote best practice, while making it easier to work effectively with our partners across the business community, third sector and trade unions.
As Scotland’s government, we will continue to work closely with Scottish businesses to increase our country’s competitiveness and make the most of the underlying strengths in Scotland’s economy so we can deliver higher levels of growth.
As part of this partnership, SNP ministers have developed a Scottish Business Pledge because we know that a stronger economy emerges from a stronger society.
The business pledge includes commitments to pay the living wage,
not use exploitative zerohour contracts
and to take forward a programme of innovation.
In return, the Scottish Government will provide targeted support and advice to help companies export, grow, innovate and become more productive.
The greater share people have in economic growth, the more they will contribute to Scotland’s economic success and so we want a national endeavour, involving our business community at its core, so we can create the wealth
and share that wealth more fairly than under the Westminster model
We will also continue our support for the living wage, ensuring it is paid to all staff covered by the Scottish Government’s public sector pay policy.
SNP MPs will press for the UK government to adopt this policy across the UK.
We know that fair pay is an important part of creating a fairer society and so will use the powers and influence we have to further promote the living wage across the private sector.
SNP MPs will work with Scottish ministers to help ensure 500 organisations are signed up to the Living Wage Accreditation Scheme within the next year, by becoming local living wage champions in their constituency.
And through guidance on procurement, the SNP will work to ensure all suppliers to the Scottish Government also pay the living wage.
Our economic strategy is designed to ensure that Scotland can take more advantage of international opportunities.
In government, we are developing a new Trade and Investment Strategy and will establish One Scotland Partnerships.
These will set clear trade and innovation goals for specific international markets and ensure that activity is coordinated to maximise impact.
Our updated International Framework will set the context for how the Scottish Government, its agencies and public bodies engage most effectively worldwide to promote Scotland for the benefit of our economy and to increase trade and investment opportunities.
330,000 Scottish jobs depend on membership of the EU single market.
SNP MPs will vote against an in/out EU referendum.
However, if there is to be a referendum, we will seek to amend the legislation to insert a 'double majority' rule unless each of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as the UK as a whole, voted to exit the EU, the UK would remain a member state
Building a fairer Scotland and tackling inequality.
The past year has shown there is a real demand for a new Scotland, where more of us can contribute fully.
Our approach in government, with its focus on early intervention, is putting in place the firm foundations for future success by giving more young Scots the best possible start in life.
We are determined to invest as much as we can in a brighter future for our young people.
That includes our current commitment to 600 hours of childcare for over 120,000 3 and 4 year olds and eligible 2 year olds.
In the coming years, we will build on this to almost double the number of free hours to 30 hours a week of free childcare by the end of the next Scottish Parliament for all 3 and 4 year olds and eligible 2 year olds.
In government, we are providing £104 million in 201516 to protect as many people as possible from the damaging impact of the welfare reforms being imposed by Westminster.
That includes mitigation of the Bedroom Tax and the Council Tax reduction scheme, which has protected 500,000 of Scotland’s lowest income households from increased Council Tax.
The Council Tax freeze has also helped hardpressed households – by 2016 the freeze will have saved households an average of £1,200, with those on low incomes seeing the biggest savings as a proportion of their household income.
We are committed to maintaining the Council Tax freeze, as set out in our 2011 election manifesto,
and will work with others to review options for future replacement for the unfair council tax system.
We are creating a statutory basis for a permanent local welfare safety net
and will, through a Carers Bill, provide further support for carers and young carers.
Of course, there is so much more we could achieve with more extensive powers over welfare.
The Scotland we all seek is one where our most important public services are protected.
In the face of new UK cuts, we remain absolutely committed to the Scottish health service.
In this manifesto we propose big increases in spending on health across the UK, which would deliver an additional £2 billion for Scotland’s NHS.
As Scotland’s government, we will continue to pass on any new Barnett consequentials from health spending in England.
Our support for the NHS has been shown this year by the £383 million increase in health resource spending, bringing it to record levels.
As a result, each and every one of Scotland’s health boards will receive above inflation spending increases next year.
We have taken steps to reduce consumption of alcohol and tobacco and to promote a more active lifestyle through sport.
We have also worked hard to remove financial barriers to treatment and care.
Free prescriptions and the commitment to continue free personal care for the elderly are an important part of delivering a healthier Scotland, and the SNP will maintain these vital policies.
We will also continue with an ambitious programme of health and social care integration, ensuring that health and social care provision across Scotland is joinedup and provides a seamless service,
especially for people with longterm conditions and disabilities.
This includes £300 million over the next three years for the Integrated Care Fund
and £30 million for telehealth.
This is additional investment that will support integration, meaning better local primary, community and care services to help keep people safe in their own homes for as long as possible.
We’ve already committed £15 million to a mental health innovation fund
and, as part of our proposals for higher health spending, will seek to increase this investment to £100 million over the next 5 years.
Resources will be directed towards projects that will improve mental health treatments in the primary care sector.
The fund will also enable further investment in child and adolescent mental health services.
Scotland was the first country in the UK to introduce waiting time targets for these services,
and we have increased the workforce by 45 per cent.
We are also investing a further £100 million over the next 3 years to help tackle delayed discharges in our hospitals.
This will ensure more spaces are available for hospital admissions and enable boards and local councils to deliver quality care for people where they live.
Our plans also include an extra £40 million for new medicines.
We will invest more in specialist nursing care, with a commitment to new spending of £2.5 million,
with the first allocation going to support patients with motorneurone disease.
We also support calls to double research funding across the UK to find a cure for motorneurone disease, with Scotland well placed to play a central role in taking forward new research in this area.
Our approach to education is based on giving our young people the skills they need to flourish, now and in later life.
The introduction of Curriculum for Excellence is a big part of this, but we are also working to improve the learning environment and to remove barriers to education for our youngest pupils
and for those entering higher and further education.
Our decision to introduce free school meals for all pupils in primary 1 to 3 is providing a welcome boost to the wellbeing of thousands of children,
boosting their capacity to learn and helping to reduce educational inequalities.
It is also saving thousands of families, many on low incomes, over £300 each year.
Our school building programme will continue, so we can further improve the teaching and learning environment.
So far we have seen 526 schools rebuilt or refurnished under the SNP almost 200 more than were delivered in the eight years of Labour and the LibDems.
Through our £1.8 billion Schools for the Future programme we will continue to invest, delivering almost 100 more new and improved buildings by 2020,
on top of projects delivered through capital expenditure by local councils.
We will deliver increased investment in the year ahead to fund an additional 250 teacher training places the fourth year in a row we have delivered an increase.
And we are providing additional resources to local councils to maintain teacher numbers.
Our new Education (Scotland) Bill will focus on ways we can improve attainment, especially among Scotland’s most disadvantaged children.
Councils will have a statutory duty to narrow the attainment gap.
The Bill includes a range of other measures, including steps to ensure all teachers are appropriately trained and qualified.
It will also focus on Gaelic education by placing a duty on councils to assess the need for Gaelic medium primary education following a parental request.
As part of our ongoing support for Gaelic, we will ensure funding for Bòrd na Gàidhlig is protected.
We will also expand entitlement to the Educational Maintenance Allowance (EMA) so that an extra 10,000 school pupils and 12,000 college students receive this important financial support, making it easier for them continue their education.
This will bring the number of young Scots receiving the EMA to 57,000.
We are proud to have delivered our unique Scottish Youth Guarantee, with a guaranteed offer of a place in training or education for all 16 to 19 year olds.
That is why we have seen an increase in fulltime college places and have committed to an increase in the number of Modern Apprenticeship places to 30,000 each year.
SNP MPs will press the UK to adopt the European Youth Guarantee to ensure faster intervention when a young person aged 16 to 24 is unemployed.
Passing power to people and delivering stronger communities.
Throughout the referendum campaign we said that decisions about Scotland’s future should be taken by the people who care most about Scotland, that is the people who live here.
That same broad principle should apply to decisions that most directly affect our local communities.
Over these coming months, we will ensure progress of the Community Empowerment Bill, which was introduced to the Parliament earlier this year.
The Bill proposes ways we can improve civic and community engagement and empowerment, including on the use of public assets.
SNP MPs will seek ways of extending the community asset transfer provisions of the legislation to include property in Scotland owned by UK government departments.
Mitigating welfare changes
The Scottish Government has been working to reduce the negative impact on households of UK welfare changes.
The UK Social Fund is now delivered by the Scottish Government and provides Crisis Grants and also Community Care Grants to enable independent living.
Following the abolition of Council Tax Benefit and the 10 percent reduction in funding made available for its replacement, the Scottish Government and Scotland’s councils, working together, are providing £40 million to ensure that no household loses out as a result of the UK change.
Over half a million households in Scotland have been protected from higher Council Tax bills.
We are also providing £35 million per year to ensure over 70,000 Scottish households can be protected from the damaging effects of the Westminster Bedroom Tax.
We have also established a new Empowering Communities Fund.
It has an additional £10 million to allocate in this coming year – enabling us to support over 200 community projects.
We are also committed to using public contracts to deliver clear community benefits,
including local employment and training opportunities
and support for community initiatives.
We will continue to take forward our partnership with Scotland’s island communities as part of the ‘Our Islands, Our Future’ project, with the clear intention to devolve new powers and responsibilities to Scotland’s three main island groups.
We will also work with local authorities to ensure that our island and coastal communities see a direct benefit from the devolution of the Crown Estate,
including full enjoyment of net income from seabed leasing revenue.
We believe that the natural wealth and resources of Scotland should deliver clearer advantages for the people who live here.
That includes one of our most valuable natural assets our land.
Our new Land Reform Bill will improve transparency and accountability of land ownership and ensure Scotland's land reform debate focuses on how Scotland's land can be best managed in the public interest to ensure it is of benefit to all of the people of Scotland.
We are also working to support increased community ownership of local energy projects, for example, through our £20 million local energy challenge fund.
This fund provides support for projects from community groups, local councils and housing associations, among others,
with the aim of delivering 500MW of locally owned renewable generation by 2020.
Our ambition is to achieve even more and we will explore ways of increasing support for community generation.
As part of our focus on meeting our climate change targets
and promoting sustainable economic growth,
we will support businesses, the third sector and public sector organisations working to boost productivity by using energy, materials and water more efficiently, so we can build a more resource efficient Scotland.
This includes work to stimulate remanufacturing networks and supply chains through the Scottish Institute of Remanufacturing, one of only four international centres of excellence.
As the Scottish Government, we are consulting on measures to reduce emissions in Scotland, including looking at the creation of Low Emission Zones.
We will continue to develop our zero waste strategy, supporting a range of initiatives, for example the ongoing pilot project for reverse vending machines to encourage rewards for recycling.
We will use our influence at Westminster to ensure the UK matches, and supports, Scotland’s ambitious commitments to carbon reduction
and that we play a positive role in the UN Climate Change conference in Paris.
We will also look for the Bank of England to continue its work on the potential impact of climate change on financial stability in the UK and report on how it can best respond.
In government we have made the promotion of Scotland’s food and drink a key priority with a particular focus on Scotland’s excellent produce as part of the 2015 Year of Food and Drink.
We will continue to work on promoting local food supply, including within the public sector.
We will seek full devolved responsibility over all food levies to support the promotion of food and drink,
so we can build on a record that has seen growth in the sector in Scotland of 20.8 per cent compared to 8.6 per cent in the UK.
Given that our whisky industry is a key national and export industry, we remain committed to a Treasury review of alcohol taxation to better reflect alcohol content, while securing health benefits through minimum pricing.
We are also taking forward the introduction of Scotland’s new rural development programme, which will provide crucial support for Scottish farming, food production, rural communities and the environment.
The new scheme is worth £1.3 billion over the next six years.
We will continue to press for speedy European signoff of Scotland’s rural development programme and, in the meantime, will continue to take action here in Scotland to minimise any delay or disruption to payments.
SNP MPs will urge the UK government to work with the European Commission to deliver a simplified CAP, in particular with a review of direct payments and Greening, in line with proposals in the Brian Pack report to reduce red tape.
We will also continue to press the Agriculture Commissioner to ensure Scottish farmers get clarity and certainty over the implementation arrangements for the new CAP.
Fishing is a very important industry for Scotland’s economy, with fishing, aquaculture and processing generating £690m
and employing around 14,300 people.
The SNP is working hard to increase revenues and profitability for the industry, with the deal secured at last December’s fisheries council adding around £10 million to the value of Scotland's whitefish and prawn stocks.
We are engaging with the industry on our review of fish quota management.
We want to ensure quotas are managed in the common interest,
so that active fishermen have access to the quota that they need, rather than seeing them concentrated in the hands of those with the deepest pockets.
We want to sustain jobs and find ways to support the entry of the next generation of skippers.
We will continue to work to ensure the discard ban is implemented in a way that does not damage the viability of the fleet and is workable for our fishermen.
Sensible implementation will deliver benefits for the fleet and consumers as we end the practice of dumping perfectly good fish back into the sea.
Our aim is to grow and strengthen local economies, both urban and rural.
By increasing the minimum wage and supporting a fair wage economy we can increase the disposable income of low and middle income households,
which will provide a direct boost to local businesses, enabling them to grow.
We are keen to see spending increase, and profits remain, within local communities so that more money is being circulated locally, generating jobs and opportunities for the benefit of all.
That is why we remain fully committed to the Small Business Bonus
and why we are expanding the Social Entrepreneurs Fund, to encourage and support community social enterprises.
We also recognise the importance of improving access to the internet, especially for some of our more remote or disadvantaged communities.
In government we are working to maximise the availability of highspeed broadband across Scotland
and are also providing funding of £1.5 million to increase free provision of WiFi in public buildings.
Our aim is to deliver a futureproofed infrastructure that will establish worldclass digital connectivity across Scotland by 2020,
including tackling the digital divide.
That is why we are investing in Superfast Broadband, so that at least 95 per cent of premises across Scotland will be able to access fibre broadband by the end of 2017.
From the very first days of the SNP in government in Scotland we have been determined to make our streets safer and to give people greater confidence and security in their communities and in their homes.
That’s why we invested in 1,000 extra police and why we are committed to retaining these extra police in our communities.
With record low crime rates and big improvements in detection, we know this is a policy that is working.
SNP MPs will join SNP ministers in pressing for all court fines income to be retained in Scotland so we can boost investment in crime reduction measures nationwide.
We will also press for Police Scotland to have the same ability to save on VAT as other police forces across the UK, enabling Scotland’s police service to invest £23 million more in frontline services.
The same VAT exemption should also apply to Scotland’s Fire and Rescue Service.
DELIVERING HOME RULE FOR SCOTLAND
The SNP believes that decisions about Scotland’s future – about our economy and society – are best taken by the people of Scotland:
the more powers we have in Scotland the more we can achieve for the people who live here.
That is why we campaigned for a Scottish Parliament and voted for the Scotland Act 1998.
It is why we supported the limited extension of devolution in the Scotland Act 2012, and called for a far more substantial package of powers at that point.
The same principle underpins our continued support for independence and was at the heart of our campaign for a Yes vote in September 2014.
During the referendum, the parties campaigning for a No vote promised the people of Scotland substantial new powers for our parliament,
amounting to real Home Rule, maximum devolution and as close to federalism as was possible.
It is our intention to hold them to that promise and the more SNP MPs elected in May, the greater our ability to deliver the strong package of effective devolution that people in Scotland want and need to build a fairer and more prosperous country.
We welcome the proposals set out in the Smith Commission, as far as they go.
The further watering down of the agreed proposals, by the UK government, is unacceptable.
There should be no effective veto for UK ministers on the exercise of the various new powers,
in particular over the welfare system.
We share the view of many organisations across Scotland that the package, as it stands, does not enable us to deliver fully either the greater social justice
or the powerhouse economy that our country demands.
As the STUC has said, “there is not enough” in the Smith Commission recommendations “to empower the Scottish Parliament to tackle inequality in Scotland".
And, we agree with the Scottish Council of Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) “that anything less than wholesale devolution of welfare would be a real missed opportunity to meet the needs of the most vulnerable people in our communities”.
The Smith Commission proposals were, in many respects, a missed opportunity.
Decisions about more than 70 per cent of Scottish taxes and 85 per cent of current UK welfare spending in Scotland will stay at Westminster.
Instead of limited and unambitious proposals on tax powers, we should have a greater ability to generate economic growth,
deliver more employment opportunities
and support family incomes with the devolution of additional taxes.
Instead of leaving decisions on wages and employment with Westminster, devolving these key areas to Scotland means we could ensure that people in Scotland receive fair pay for a day’s work.
We could bring together, more effectively, skills development and employment support – enabling us to get more people into wellpaid and rewarding employment, closer to home.
And, instead of choices on most aspects of our welfare system remaining at Westminster, the full devolution of the welfare state would give us the ability to halt the cruelest and most damaging welfare changes and instead develop a system that supports people and families in their time of need.
It is only with the more extensive devolution of welfare, wages, taxation and the economy that we can deliver greater prosperity for more of our citizens and for Scotland as a whole.
Powers for a Purpose
Our focus, therefore, will be securing specific new economic and social powers, over and above those set out in the Smith Commission proposals,
so we can tailor policy to make much more of the country’s strengths and finally address the challenges that we face as a society.
Scotland should have the opportunity to establish its own constitutional framework, including human rights, equalities and the place of local government.
The Scottish Parliament should also have the ability to directly represent its interests on devolved matters in the EU and internationally.
With more meaningful tax powers, we could provide more incentives and support for businesses to invest in Scotland
and enter new markets overseas,
encouraging inward investment and boosting our international exports.
We could also use targeted changes in business tax allowances to encourage higher levels of investment in capital or Research & Development, and encourage the growth of SMEs.
Proper economic powers would enable a fully cohesive industrial strategy focused on strengthening manufacturing and boosting innovation, allowing us to revitalise Scotland’s industries and rebalance our economy.
Full control over social protection would allow the Scottish Parliament to tailor a new and fairer welfare system for Scotland.
For example, no Scottish Government would have introduced the Bedroom Tax in Scotland and, looking forward, we would be able to protect people from any future ideological attacks from Westminster on the very essence of our social security system.
Devolving employment policy would allow us to take progressive action on low pay in order to tackle poverty and inequality,
with the power to raise the minimum wage, regardless of the political balance at Westminster
and we could more closely integrate skills and employment policy to support people in their search for rewarding work.
Securing Home Rule
We will use the influence of SNP votes at Westminster to ensure that the promises made to Scotland during the referendum are delivered.
We will demand, firstly, that the proposals of the Smith Commission are delivered quickly and in full.
However, we believe that the proposals of the Smith Commission do not go far enough to honour the promises made during the referendum.
We will seek agreement that the Scottish Parliament should move to full financial responsibility.
As implementation of the Calman Commission proposals and the Scotland Act 2012 have demonstrated, the transition to full fiscal responsibility and agreement of the detailed fiscal framework that would require to underpin it would take a number of years to complete.
SNP MPs will work with the Scottish Government to secure the best deal for Scotland in these negotiations.
In the meantime, we will prioritise devolution of powers over employment policy, including the minimum wage,
welfare,
business taxes, national insurance
and equality policy
the powers we need to create jobs,
grow revenues
and lift people out of poverty.
As we set out in our submission to the Smith Commission, the Barnett Formula should continue to be used to determine Scotland's resources during the transition to full fiscal responsibility and for as long as the Scottish Parliament's financial powers fall short of full responsibility.
SCOTLAND’S OPPORTUNITY
This General Election is an exciting opportunity for Scotland to have real power at Westminster.
The SNP goes into this election with a clear message none of us can afford more austerity//.
Our NHS, our economy and our children can't afford the billions of pounds of additional cuts that the Tories, Labour and Liberals have signed up to.
And none of us can afford the £100 billion they plan to spend on new nuclear weapons.
The Westminster parties have the wrong priorities.
And it will be ordinary people across the UK who will pay the price.
Unless you choose differently.
Labour alone won't be bold enough to deliver the change ordinary people need.
A big team of SNP MPs can force the pace of progressive change.
We offer an alternative.
A responsible plan for modest spending increases
and real investment in the NHS, housing, childcare
and jobs.
An SNP vote on May 7th will be a vote to make Scotland's voice heard loudly and clearly.
But ours will also be a voice for a new, better and more progressive politics at Westminster for everyone.
