The liberal metropolitan elite often tells us patriotism is wrong, that it is something to be discouraged.
We are told we should be ashamed of our past; that we must apologise for it.
Hints are dropped that wanting to celebrate ‘Britishness’ is an act that touches on extremism.
We in UKIP, along with the vast majority of the British people, beg to differ.
We are not afraid to talk about the kind of country we are, have been, and indeed, want to be in the future.
Neither are we afraid to tackle head-on cultural issues of crucial importance.
This clearly distinguishes us from the other parties, who have sought to denigrate our historic values of sovereignty, democracy, independence, patriotism and freedom by handing responsibility for Governance over to the EU.
REINVIGORATING BRITISH CULTURE AND VALUES
UKIP will promote a unifying British culture, open to anyone who wishes to identify with Britain and British values, regardless of their ethnic or religious background.
This is genuine inclusiveness.
We reject multiculturalism, the doctrine whereby different ethnic and religious groups are encouraged to maintain all aspects of their cultures, instead of integrating into our majority culture, even if some of their values and customs conflict with British ones.
We believe multiculturalism has led to an alarming fragmentation of British society.
UKIP does want people to integrate and,
because we believe in Britain,
we are also committed to promoting the English language as a common ingredient that will bind our society together.
With these aims in mind, UKIP will: End the use of multi-lingual formatting on official documents.
These will be published only in English and, where appropriate, Welsh and Gaelic
Uphold freedom of speech within the law
as a fundamental British value.
We believe all ideas and beliefs should be open to discussion and scrutiny and we will challenge the ‘culture of offence’ as it risks shutting down free speech
Recognise that British values include tolerance of religion.
UKIP is committed to protecting religious freedoms for all believers in the UK, in accordance with Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
We believe, however, that those faiths and beliefs must exist firmly within a British framework.
We will not condone any faith position which is itself intolerant and refuses to recognise the human rights of others
Uphold the integrity of British law, ensuring it applies to all, equally.
We will not condone parallel or conflicting systems that deny equality under the law
Insist that those attending faith-based tribunals must be informed that they cannot be forced to attend and that the rulings from such hearings may not be legally binding under British law
Review funding for public bodies which promote divisiveness through multiculturalism
Introduce a mandatory reporting requirement for suspected cases of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) for front-line professionals such as teachers, social services, GPs, nurses and police.
This will be supported by the inclusion of FGM awareness into safeguarding training for teachers, school staff and governors.
TAKING PRIDE IN BRITAIN
We need to take pride in our country again and claim back our heritage from the ‘chattering classes’ who have denigrated our culture, highlighted our failings as a country, rather than celebrating our successes, and tried to make us ashamed to be British.
UKIP will encourage pride in Britain among our young people, who have become detached from our national cultural heritage.
UKIP supports a chronological understanding of British history and achievements in the National Curriculum, which should place due emphasis on the unique influence Britain has had in shaping the modern world.
UKIP will declare St George’s Day, 23rd April a Bank Holiday in England
and St David’s Day, 1st March, in Wales.
TRADE
“We do not need to be in political union with the EU in order to trade with the EU.
Britain will continue to trade with the EU after Brexit and to say otherwise is a deliberate deceit on the electors of our country.
Leaving means we can increase our trade reach in the world’s growing markets, on our own, for ourselves, without being shackled to an over-bureaucratic, failing EU market that dilutes our influence and produces little except low economic growth and high unemployment.”
The longer we stay in the European Union, the more we become like ‘little Englanders,’ an isolated, insignificant, offshore province in a country called Europe.
We become less and less like the ‘Great’ Britain we really are.
We are a global trading nation,
a G7 country,
the world’s fifth largest economy.
The UK is the fourth largest exporter of goods worldwide;
the seventh largest manufacturing nation;
a permanent member of the UN Security Council;
a founder-member of the World Bank
and the Commonwealth of Nations;
one of the major players in NATO.
English is the most widely-spoken business language and London the world’s leading international financial centre.
Is it astonishing how many politicians claim we are ‘too small’ to go it alone.
These blinkered doomsayers are not just unpatriotic, they are very, very wrong.
OUT OF THE EU AND INTO THE WORLD
Prior to joining the EU, Britain struck her own trade deals and traded freely across the globe.
We surrendered our trade negotiating rights when we signed up to what was then the EEC and vacated our seat on the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
Britain has not negotiated a single trade deal since 1975 and, while we remain in the EU, we will never negotiate one again.
UKIP believes we can trade again, very successfully, by re-activating our seat at the WTO, where we can negotiate as a full and independent member.
EU TRADE MYTHS EXPLODED
We do not have to be members of the EU in order to trade with the EU, or any other country.
More than sixty non-EU countries have trade deals with the EU.
In 2013, the top twenty of these, countries such as Switzerland, Norway, Hong Kong, Canada, Nigeria, Mexico and Australia, together exported goods and services worth €2.593 trillion to EU countries, according to the EU’s own figures, more than our entire economy in the same year.
Moreover, six of the top ten countries that export to the EU do not have a trade agreement with the EU at all: China, Russia, the USA, Japan, India and Brazil.
Being in the EU is no guarantee of greater financial rewards than being out in terms of trade:
non-EU Switzerland, with an economy one-quarter the size of ours, exports four and a half times more to the EU, per capita, than the UK does.
The inconvenient truth for our Europhile political class is that political union offers no advantages to trade, although it may inhibit it.
We export more to the USA – some £40 billion annually – than we do to either France or Germany, our largest EU markets, without having to become the fifty-first American state and without the free movement of people between our nations.
TRADE ON ‘BREXIT,’ BRITISH EXIT FROM THE EU
Once the UK leaves the EU, we, as a country, regain our ability to take back our vacant seat at the WTO and represent ourselves, negotiating our own trade agreements and advancing our own national trade interests.
A first step would be to broker a bespoke UK-EU trade agreement, which we believe is desirable.
This is what we will seek and without doubt achieve, possibly within a very short period of time.
The UK has been a leader in international trade for centuries, long before the European Union.
We will continue to trade internationally after Brexit, enjoying the rights inherent in the WTO’s ‘Most Favoured Nation’ principle.
We will regain full autonomy at the World Customs Organisation, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and several of the UN’s constituent bodies - all of which have seen a steady erosion of our voting powers, as the EU has assumed primacy.
With over 100 other international organisations counting the UK as a full member, we will be in a very strong negotiating position when we leave the EU.
Suggestions that the EU would refuse to negotiate a trade deal with Britain if we left the Union are nothing more than scaremongering.
Britain is the Eurozone’s biggest export market worldwide, the Eurozone’s biggest supplier worldwide, and the country with which the Eurozone has the biggest trade surplus worldwide.
The truth is, the EU cannot afford to snub us: the EU actually needs us far more than we need the EU.
It is time to free Britain from the shackles of the EU.
We have a choice between a dying Europe and a vibrant, growing world;
a choice between staying buried in the bureaucratic nightmare of Brussels, and resuming our proper place in the rest of the world.
The common sense answer is to leave.
DEFENCE
“The world is aflame with conflict, yet our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone.
We need a well-resourced, properly manned and fit-for-purpose defence capacity,
but our ability to defend British interests around the world is now seriously inhibited.
Our security at home is threatened and cuts have put additional strain on already  over-stretched and under-resourced troops.”
The Government continues to signal its intention to widen engagement in international conflicts while, at the same time, implementing a crippling round of further military spending cuts,  under the auspices of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR).
The Army is tasked with reducing personnel numbers to 82,000 by 2018, down from 102,500 in 2010.
Battle tank strength has been cut by 40 per cent and there has been a 35 per cent cut in self-propelled artillery.
The Conservatives’ ambition to recruit 30,000 personnel to the Territorial Army is failing.
Together, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy have suffered more than 10,000 job losses.
The Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft programme has been cancelled.
The aircraft carrier fleet has been decommissioned, despite having no operational replacements available until 2020.
These cuts have demoralised our Armed Forces and left the nation unprepared to face emerging threats.
REBUILDING OUR ARMED FORCES
Our current level of military spending and staffing is not fulfilling the terms of our NATO membership - which requires that we spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence -
and the government has failed to lay out details of spending plans beyond 2015/16.
On the basis that the current base level of defence spending is maintained after 2015/16 at 1.9 per cent, UKIP will increase the defence budget to meet our obligations to NATO and spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence in 2015/16.
We will exceed it substantially for the remaining years of the parliament.
We will phase in increased defence spending over the next five years up to an additional £4 billion by 2020.
This will return funding to the pre-SDSR level, and allow for £1 billion yearly expenditure on capital projects deemed to be of the highest strategic priority by the MoD.
We will rebuild our Armed Forces and restore them to their rightful place among the most professional, flexible and effective fighting forces in the world, able to meet the security demands of the modern era and react appropriately to any threat that the UK faces both now and in the future.
RETAIN OUR NUCLEAR DETERRENT
Faced with rogue states such as North Korea and Iran, which have developed advanced nuclear capabilities, UKIP does not believe now is the time to be talking about or proposing nuclear disarmament and we support Trident renewal.
AIRCRAFT CARRIERS
The two new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers are superb operational platforms.
UKIP supports their deployment, while having reservations about the Royal Navy’s ability to man, operate and protect them:
it could take nearly every ship in the current fleet to form an effective carrier group.
We also have reservations about the development of the American F-35B Lightning II aircraft that are due to fly from the carriers by 2020, given the massive technical problems involved.
This platform may never be mission-capable.
We will investigate further whether it would be better to commission an ‘off-the-shelf’ aircraft option and adapt the two Queen Elizabeth class carriers for non-vertical take-off and landings.
INCREASING INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY
Currently, British intelligence is fragmented between a number of agencies, including MI5, MI6, GCHQ and BBC Monitoring.
All have different funding streams and report to different government departments.
This generates a significant overlap in work and resources and risks exposing gaps in the system.
UKIP will create a new over-arching role of Director of National Intelligence (subject to confirmation hearing by the relevant Commons Select Committee), who will be charged with reviewing UK intelligence and security, in order to ensure threats are identified, monitored and dealt with by the swiftest, most appropriate and legal means available.
He or she will be responsible for bringing all intelligence services together; developing cyber security measures; cutting down on waste and encouraging information and resource sharing.
TAX ON ACTIVE SERVICE
UKIP will revise the Armed Forces terms of service to ensure personnel on operational duty overseas do not pay income tax.
EU ARMY
UKIP wholly opposes the creation of a EU Army.
We will not tolerate British troops operating under European command, on British soil or elsewhere.
HONOURING THE MILITARY COVENANT
Wherever we send our brave heroes, whatever the danger, they never let us down.
We will not let them down.
We will honour the Military Covenant.
UKIP will create a dedicated Minister for Veterans, attached to the Cabinet Office to head up a Veterans Administration (VA).
The VA will work with current MoD veteran services and established charities to provide a single point of contact for veterans in a range of fields:
health care, housing, counselling, education and training, rehabilitation, hospital care, access to veteran financial services, benefits and memorialisation.
Issues such as veteran homelessness, drug and alcohol abuse and mental health problems will also come under this remit, as will rolling out the following initiatives by 2020:
A DEDICATED MILITARY HOSPITAL
We believe members of our Armed Forces should have access to expert care services, configured to meet the specific needs of serving forces personnel and veterans.
Britain is the only major country in Europe that does not have a dedicated military hospital, so we will build one.
It will provide specialist physical and mental health services and provide accommodation for 150 relatives or friends on site.
HOSTELS FOR HOMELESS VETERANS
9,000 homeless people are ex-forces, as are one in ten people sleeping rough on the streets, according to charities Combat Stress and Crisis.
That those who have been willing to defend our homeland have ended up without a home themselves is appalling.
By 2020, UKIP will build eight halfway house veterans’ hostels, each with 200 rooms and modelled on similar hostels already in operation.
We will also built 500 affordable rent homes every year for ex-forces personnel.
JOBS FOR EX-SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN
We will guarantee the offer of a job in the police service, prison service or border force for anyone who has served in the Armed Forces for a minimum of 12 years.
This policy will also help meet our pledge to fund an additional 6,000 full time positions across these three organisations.
We will secure our borders, get more police on the streets, have safer prisons and honour the Military Covenant.
BOOTS TO BUSINESS
Skills gained in the forces can be useful when running a small business.
We will create a ‘Boots to Business’ scheme to channel loans, grants and access to free professional advice and mentors to veterans who wish to set up and run their own businesses after leaving the forces.
SUPPORTING OUR HEROES AND THEIR FAMILIES
Key roles for the VA will include bereavement support;
the issue of a veteran service card to ensure fast-track access to NHS mental health care;
and the award of a National Defence Medal to all veterans, irrespective of rank or length of service.
The current anomaly in the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme will be rectified, so no veteran has to use their war pension to pay for social care, whenever they were injured.
These entitlements will be extended to service personnel from overseas.
If they have shared the responsibility, stress and danger associated with military service, they should be entitled to exactly the same benefits as the man or woman who stood at their side.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
“Britain’s role in the world has changed significantly over the past few decades.
Instead of concerning ourselves with securing peace, British forces have been deployed around the world in a series of conflicts that seem to have worsened, instead of improved, our security situation.”
Since 1997, Labour and the Conservative/Lib Dem Coalition have deployed our Armed Forced to conflicts in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Libya and Iraq, while maintaining the ‘War on Terror’.
They proposed military action in Syria.
More recently, Parliament approved air strikes over Iraq on Islamic State.
Latest deployments include deterrent exercises in Poland and the Baltic States and a little publicised, but substantial, deployment to Nigeria.
These interventions have stretched the UK’s Armed Forces to the limit and damaged our reputation in the international community.
They have caused social problems here at home
and jaded the British public’s attitude towards involvement in future conflicts.
Iraq is a much more dangerous place today.
So is Libya
Britain’s increasing involvement with European Union expansionism is putting us increasingly, unnecessarily, at loggerheads with Russia.
The MoD recently told Ukraine it can count on ‘any possible assistance’ in maintaining its territorial integrity.
It is yet another sign that our political leaders are willing to put our troops in harm’s way at the behest of other country’s political agendas.
We have to be clear: we should stand firmly alongside our allies around the world,
but cannot continue committing troops into conflict at the drop of a hat – often under-resourced -
and with a veterans policy that lets down those returning from the horrors of war.
Our commitment to NATO must be upheld and we will not shirk our responsibilities towards our allies,
but UKIP believes our parliamentary democracy should be consulted at every opportunity, before committing any taxpayer resources, or our forces, to combat situations.
UKIP acknowledges there are real, existential threats around the world.
The rise of Islamic extremism is at the forefront of this and, indeed, is possibly the most important battle of our generation.
But the fight with and against this ideology is not best fought on a battlefield 3,000 miles away,
but at home, where we have significant problems of radicalisation and incitement to terrorism
.
In Europe, UKIP would push for commitments from our European neighbours, as well as multi-national organisations, to guarantee the British sovereignty and territorial integrity of Gibraltar and its waters.
In the South Atlantic, we must not ‘negotiate’ or kowtow to Argentine aggression over the Falkland Islands, but uphold and respect the islanders’ decision – through the self-determination of a recent referendum – their overwhelming desire and right to remain British.
In the Middle East, UKIP wants to see nations at peace,
but acknowledges that sectarianism, fuelled by historical Western involvement, has rendered this all but impossible within a generation.
We want to see a peaceful, two-state solution in Israel and the Palestinian territories.
Britain is not merely a European country, but part of a global community, the Anglosphere.
Beyond the EU and even the Commonwealth are a network of nations that share not merely our language but our common law, democratic traditions and global trading interests.
From India to the United States, New Zealand to the Caribbean, UKIP would want to foster closer ties with the Anglosphere.
Around the rest of the globe, UKIP’s policies, including opening up from a small, Euro-centric view of the world – wherein we are bound by EU membership not to negotiate our own trade deals- to becoming a sovereign nation that can trade with other countries, would once again inform our foreign policy.
Once unbound from the EU, Britain would once again take her place in the family of nations as an independent, sovereign state, free to negotiate her own trade deals and determine her own foreign policy objectives.
We believe nations which trade with one another are less likely to go to war with each other and, it is on this basis, that we would seek to create a more global Britain, fully able to pursue her own interests.
“Ultimately, UKIP wants to help lift people out of poverty through trade, not aid.
In the meantime, we’ll continue to support the poorest people on earth through programmes that prioritise clean water and sanitation, vaccinations and disaster relief.”
The politics of austerity has taken its toll.
Hundreds of thousands of people in Britain are relying on foodbanks for survival.
`Pensioners are freezing to death in winter as a result of rising fuel bills.
The NHS is under severe financial strain.
Social care budgets have been slashed, leaving some of the most needy in our society without adequate support.
Our young people have been forced into debt by a 200 per cent increase in tuition fees.
Despite this severe economic hardship, MPs and peers in all parties except UKIP voted to massively increase foreign aid expenditure, borrowing money that will increase the national debt we leave to our children.
It is now enshrined in law that we must pay 0.7 per cent of our Gross National Income (GNI) on aid every year.
The old parties pushed ahead with this expenditure regardless, ignoring considerable evidence that the money spent on overseas aid is not well directed or controlled and that much is wasted, lost to corruption or handed to countries already wealthy enough to have their own space programmes, nuclear weapons and even overseas aid programmes of their own.
UKIP will repeal recent legislation committing aid spending to 0.7 per cent of GNI.
We object to taxpayers’ money being sent to already economically thriving countries;
countries with poor human rights’ records;
and to money being spent on politically correct vanity projects that do nothing to lift developing nations out of poverty.
We also believe charity should begin at home.
UKIP will bring overseas aid spending into line with that of the United States, which has a very similar level of deficit and overall debt as a percentage of GNI to the UK.
USA aid currently stands at 0.2 per cent of GNI and this is what we will match.
This change will be phased in over three years and the UK level of overseas aid will remain substantial, not falling below £4 billion per annum, more than given by Spain and Italy combined.
Projects in progress will be completed and any contractual obligations met.
We will require all project expenditure to have clear, definable outcomes and future spending priorities will focus on emergency relief, healthcare, inoculation against preventable diseases and clean water and sanitation programmes.
The contracts for delivery of these programmes will be offered to British providers first, following removal of the EU Procurement Directive.
TRADE NOT AID
Removing barriers to trade is a far more effective way to tackle poverty than giving aid hand-outs, which can provide incentives for corrupt leaders to stifle economic progress.
This is where UKIP will focus: having escaped from the EU’s protectionism, which has a negative impact on international development,
we will be better placed to help provide sustainable livelihoods for the world’s poorest people, by giving them free access to the British market.
THE DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (DFID)
DFID has already shown itself to be wasteful and lacking in focus on aid outcomes, yet its budget has been protected from recent government cuts.
UKIP takes a very different view: when DFID’s budget is reduced, we see no reason to keep DIFD running as an independent Government department.
We will close DFID and merge its essential functions into the Foreign Office, retaining a single Minister for Overseas Development.
BREXIT
WHY WE SHOULD  LEAVE THE EU
UKIP’s position has been quite unfairly and misleadingly labelled ‘anti-Europe.’
We are not ‘anti-Europe,’ but we are firmly opposed to political integration within Europe.
Back in 1972, we were told we were joining a ‘common market.’
What we actually joined was a supranational political union.
We have lost our rights of self-government in the stealth creation of a United States of Europe, which has its own flag, national anthem, parliament, central bank, court of justice, a vast civil service, and fledgling military and police forces.
The tentacles of the EU stretch into almost every area of our national life.
The EU has complete control over British financial services, fishing, farming, energy and trade.
It dictates UK business and employment legislation and immigration rules.
It seeks greater control over our law enforcement services, our foreign affairs and tax policy.
There is significant momentum behind plans for a EU-wide army and police force.
The EU ‘shares’ responsibility with us for many other policy areas, including animal welfare, consumer protection, public health, space programmes, social policy, humanitarian aid and vocational training, to mention but a few.
On these and many other issues, our elected Westminster politicians are impotent.
They pretend to have the power to influence these matters, but actually they have none.
It is an out-of-sight, unaccountable, pan-European bureaucratic elite which has the final say and they do not consider Britain’s best interests.
The European Parliament is no safeguard.
It is a sham democracy: our MEPs are not allowed to generate or re-visit existing legislation.
They can only vote on decisions made by unelected Commissioners and, even then, their vote can be ignored.
We have nothing to lose and everything to gain by leaving the EU.
Despite the fact we are the world’s fifth largest economy and the seventh largest manufacturing nation, we will never again make a direct trade deal with any other nation until we leave the EU.
We will never control our borders or manage immigration.
We will never be able to prevent foreign trawlers plundering our seas of precious fish.
If the EU’s plans for ‘tax harmonisation’ come to fruition, soon we may find we cannot even set our own taxes.
What else is coming down the tracks?
A British exit from the EU, ‘Brexit,’ is the only choice open to us, if we are to make our own laws and control our own destiny.
Unless we leave, our democracy, our law-making powers and our sovereignty will continue to be salami-sliced away by the EU.
Genuine reform is impossible: successive EU Presidents, senior officials and European Prime Ministers have confirmed there is no hope of Britain negotiating any opt-outs, or special treatment.
As far as our ‘influence’ goes, we have very little anyway.
As the European Union has expanded, our vote share in the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament, and the European Commission, has declined to the point where it is now almost insignificant.
We can vote ‘no’ to proposals as often as we like, but unless other countries agree, measures will go on become British law anyway.
For all these reasons and more, Britain is better off out.
This is our roadmap to freedom: the process that will lead Great Britain out of the EU and into the world.
A REFERENDUM ON MEMBERSHIP
UKIP believes British citizens should have an in/out referendum on our membership of the EU as soon as possible.
Our question of choice will be:
DO YOU WISH BRITAIN TO BE A FREE, INDEPENDENT, SOVEREIGN DEMOCRACY?
Only British citizens will be allowed to vote and there will be strict spending limits for both ‘yes’ and ‘no’ camps, together with fair, balanced and equal media coverage of both arguments.
Following a vote to leave, we have two legal options:
We repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and leave immediately
We activate Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and notify the European Council that the UK has decided to leave the EU in two years’ time.
The second option provides for a sensible, orderly exit and this is the option we prefer.
PREPARATION FOR WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EU
Having activated Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, we will set a fixed date, two years ahead, on which we intend to leave, while recognising we could leave earlier.
Then we will begin amicable negotiations.
British exit will be a huge relief for many other EU members, who have known all along that the vast majority of the British people find the idea of political union with the rest of Europe abhorrent.
They are fully aware that we would never have joined the EU, had the political nature of the enterprise not been deliberately concealed from the electorate in 1975.
Our leaving will set them free to have full political union, if that is what they really want
and set us free to make the most of all our links with the Commonwealth,
with North America,
Australasia, much of Africa, the Indian subcontinent and all the other countries where English is the first or second language, as well as, of course, with Europe and the EU itself.
The UK is the EU’s largest export market
and, militarily, the strongest European member of NATO.
With Russia once more flexing its muscles and controlling much of the energy supplies to Western Europe, the other EU member states will have more than a casual interest in making sure their relationship with us remains amicable.
AGREEING BREXIT: THE OBJECTIVES
What do we wish to achieve from our negotiations with the EU?
Our objectives are clear: Firstly, we will secure trade agreements with the EU, the 40 nations with trade agreements with the EU and other nations of interest to us.
As a G7 member, a leading world economy, the fifth largest by GDP, this will be a rapid process in most cases.
Countries already trading with the EU will want to continue seamless trade relationships;
other world nations will want to forge new trade alliances with the UK;
and all nations will find it easier to deal with the UK directly.
As a minimum, we will seek continued access on free-trade terms to the EU’s single market.
Our custom is valuable to the EU now and will continue to be so following Brexit.
Secondly, there will be a wide range of issues on which we will want to continue to co-operate.
These include extradition treaties,
cross-border intelligence,
disaster relief,
accommodation of refugees,
pan-EU healthcare arrangements
and various other cultural projects.
We will also maintain our membership of pan-European institutions, such as the European Space Agency and the European Medicines Agency.
AGREEING BREXIT: THE PROCESS
The Foreign Secretary will oversee the Brexit process and establish a Post-EU Secretariat, with responsibility for:
Co-ordinating the disengagement
Reviewing of EU legislation and directives as they affect each area of government
Determining the post-EU status of all EU treaties
Re-establishing the UK’s membership of the World Trade Organisation
Commencing free-trade agreement negotiations with non-EU countries
Agreeing a UK/EU trade agreement
Agreeing a UK/EU Brexit Treaty
For 40 years the UK and the EU have been pulling in different directions:
Brexit will leave us free to fulfil our different destinies, while enjoying mutually beneficial and prosperous relationships with each other.
