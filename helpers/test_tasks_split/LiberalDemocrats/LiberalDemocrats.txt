Identify practical alternatives to the use of closed material procedures within the justice system, including the provisions of the 2013 Justice and Security Act,
with the aim of restoring the principle of open justice.
8.4 Securing liberty online
In the modern digital age, the power of the state and of corporate interests can threaten our privacy and liberty.
We have achieved much in rolling back the over-mighty state –  passing the first ever Protection of Freedoms Act to restore lost civil liberties,
securing the ongoing root and branch review of RIPA
and legislating for the creation of a Privacy and Civil Liberties Board –  but we cannot be complacent.
There will be a complete overhaul of surveillance powers in 2016.
We need to ensure this and other opportunities are seized as a chance to control excessive state power,
and ensure that in an era when surveillance is easier than ever before, we maintain the right to privacy and free speech.
Privacy should always be the norm for personal data, meaning surveillance must always be justified and proportionate
and any demand to read private encrypted communications must be targeted and proportionate.
We will: Pass a Digital Bill of Rights, to define and enshrine the digital rights of the citizen.
Safeguard the essential freedom of the internet and back net neutrality, the principle that internet service providers should enable access to all lawful content and applications regardless of the source, and without favouring or blocking particular products or websites.
Oppose the introduction of the so-called Snooper’s Charter.
We blocked the draft Communications Data Bill and would do so again.
Requiring companies to store a record of everyone’s internet activities for a year
or to collect third-party communications data for non-business purposes is disproportionate and unacceptable,
as is the blanket surveillance of our paper post.
Set stricter limits on surveillance and consider carefully the outcomes of the reviews we initiated on surveillance legislation by the Royal United Services Institute and the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation David Anderson QC.
We are opposed to the blanket collection of UK residents’ personal communications by the police or the intelligence agencies.
Access to metadata, live content, or the stored content of personal communications must only take place without consent where there is reasonable suspicion of criminal activity or to prevent threats to life.
Securing our rights and freedoms in law
800 years after Magna Carta, the need for written, legal guarantees of our rights and liberties has not gone away.
We will: Protect the Human Rights Act
and enshrine the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in UK law.
We will take appropriate action to comply with decisions of UK courts and the European Court of Human Rights.
Block any further attempts to limit the right to trial by jury.
Pass a new Freedoms Act, to protect citizens from excessive state powers.
Our Freedoms Act will: Tighten the regulation of CCTV, with more powers for the Surveillance Camera Commissioner.
Extend the rules governing storage of DNA and fingerprints by public authorities to include all biometric data – like facial images.
Protect free speech by ensuring insulting words, jokes, and non-intentional acts, are not treated as criminal,
and that social media communications are not treated more harshly than other media.
Prevent heavy-handed policing of demonstrations by tightly regulating the use of ‘kettling’.
Reform joint enterprise laws.
Ban high-frequency Mosquito devices which discriminate against young people.
Strengthen safeguards to prevent pre-emptive arrests and misuse of pre-charge bail conditions to restrict civil liberties and stifle peaceful protest.
End the Ministerial veto on release of information under the Freedom of Information Act.
Cut back on the petty over-regulation of everyday life, like removing licensing requirements for leafleting for community events,
liberalising the restrictions on songs and readings at wedding ceremonies,
and permitting swimming in open bodies of water.
Our Digital Bill of Rights will:Enshrine the principle that everyone has the right to control their own personal data, and that everyone should be able to view, correct, and (where appropriate and proportionate) delete their personal data, wherever it is held.
Forbid any public body from collecting, storing or processing personal data without statutory authority,
and require any such legislation to be regularly reviewed.
Give increased powers and resources for the Information Commissioner and introduce custodial sentences for egregious breaches of the Data Protection Act.
Ensure privacy is protected to the same extent in telecoms and online as in the offline world.
Public authorities should only invade an individual’s privacy where there is reasonable suspicion of criminal activity or where it is otherwise necessary and proportionate to do so in the public interest, and with appropriate oversight by the courts.
Ensure that privacy policies and terms and conditions of online services, including smartphone apps, must be clear, concise and easy for the user to understand.
Uphold the right of individuals, businesses and public bodies to use strong encryption to protect their privacy and security online.
Make it clear that online services have a duty to provide age-appropriate policies, guidance and support to the children and young people who use their services.
Secure communities Policing, justice and the border force
With Liberal Democrats in government, crime is down 10%.
That means fewer homes burgled, fewer communities blighted and fewer people hurt.
But there is much more to do to reduce crime and free people from fear.
The best way to protect the public is to stop crime from happening in the first place, whether by designing out crime, intervening early, or with effective punishments that challenge offenders and address their criminal behaviour.
We will make sure the number one priority for the criminal justice system is to prevent crime by cutting reoffending.
No one can fulfil their potential if they live in fear.
By ensuring our laws are upheld, we can build strong communities with opportunity for all.

We will make sure the number one priority for the criminal justice system is to prevent crime by cutting reoffending.
We have begun to tackle abuse in our immigration system, too, closing colleges that break the rules,
cracking down on illegal working
and human trafficking,
and reintroducing border checks.
We will build on this record to rebuild confidence in our borders and immigration system.
A Record of Delivery
Cut crime by 10%, with evidence-based policing directed at the front line
Improved treatment for addiction and mental health problems in prison
More prisoners working longer hours with wages contributing to a Victims’ Fund

and ending the awful practice of Female Genital Mutilation
Reintroduced border checks so we know who is coming in and leaving the UK
A Promise of More
Focus policing on crime prevention, saving money by scrapping Police and Crime Commissioners
Cut crime with specialist drug courts and non-criminal punishments that help addicts get clean
Reform prisons to focus on turning offenders away from a life of crime
End FGM at home and abroad in a generation,

and crack down on domestic violence
Complete border checks and use the information to improve our visa rules and deport people with no right to stay
9.1 Preventing crime
Crime and fear of crime are amongst the greatest threats to our security and our ability to live our lives to the full.
Our focus is on trying to prevent crime from happening in the first place.
We will: Design out opportunities for crime, by improving the built environment,
the design of new technologies,
and community resilience.
Strengthen the What Works centre within the College of Policing and require HM Inspectorate of Constabulary to scrutinise the use of evidence by local forces in designing their policing plans.
Build on the success of crime maps to use data more effectively to reduce crime,
working towards the publication of business-by-business data for crimes committed on commercial premises,
and exploring the feasibility of mandatory reporting of fraud losses by individual credit and debit card providers.
9.2 Improving local policing
We are successfully bringing down crime and improving the efficiency of our police forces, but there is more to do.
We believe the police could be far more effective with proper support and shared best practice.
We will: Guarantee the police pursue the public’s priorities by replacing Police and Crime Commissioners with Police Boards made up of Councillors from across the force area.
Encourage police forces and other emergency services to work together at a local, regional and national level to reduce back office costs and deliver efficiency savings.
Support and expand Police Now, which is bringing high-flying graduates and skilled mid-career professionals into our police forces.
Explore the case for transferring responsibility for more serious national crime to the National Crime Agency, enabling local police forces to focus on local crime and anti-social behaviour.
Step up our work with EU partners to tackle serious and organised crime.
9.3 Improve support for victims of crime
The criminal justice system exists to protect the public from crime; where crime does occur victims are our first priority.
We need to make sure they, and their families, are supported both in the aftermath of crimes and throughout the justice system.
We will: Enact a Victims’ Bill of Rights.
Create a single point of contact for victims to give early access to information and support.
Change sentencing guidelines to increase sentences available for hate crimes.
Give victims of crime a right to review what progress police have made to investigate the crime committed against them including cases where the police have declined to investigate.
Give victims a right to choose restorative justice.
Implement the Modern Slavery Strategy to reduce people trafficking and support victims.
9.4 Tackling violence against women and girls
A fair society cannot tolerate today’s unacceptable level of violence against women and girls in Britain.
We have made progress since 2010 but we will not rest until women feel safe and respected.
We will: Ensure teachers, social workers, police officers and health workers in areas where there is high prevalence of female genital mutilation or forced marriage are trained to help those at risk.
Require the teaching of sexual consent in schools as part of age-appropriate sex and relationships education.
Improve the provision of rape crisis centres and refuges for victims of domestic violence with a national network and national sources of funding.
Protect funding for tackling violence against women and girls and maintain the post of International Champion for preventing this violence.
Create a national helpline for victims of domestic and sexual violence – regardless of gender – to provide support, encourage reporting and secure more convictions.
Work to ensure the whole criminal justice system updates practice in line with the Director of Public Prosecutions’ guidance on sexual consent.
9.5 Improving justice and rehabilitating offenders
The criminal justice system can do more to turn people away from a life of crime.
We have made progress in government, for the first time providing probation support for offenders serving sentences of less than twelve months.
Yet still, far too many people are simply warehoused in prison, instead of learning skills that will enable them to earn an honest living when they are released.
We believe that a large prison population is a sign of failure to rehabilitate, not a sign of success.
So our aim is to significantly reduce the prison population by using more effective alternative punishments and correcting offending behaviour.
We will: Prioritise prison for dangerous offenders and those who commit the most serious offences with increased use of tough non-custodial punishments including weekend or evening custody, curfews, unpaid work in the community and GPS tagging.
This will enable us to introduce a presumption against short-term sentences that will help reduce the prison population and cut crime.
Promote Community Justice Panels and other local schemes designed to stop problems from escalating.
Extend the role of the Youth Justice Board to all offenders aged under 21,
give them the power to commission mental health services
and devolve youth custody budgets to Local Authorities.
Create a Women’s Justice Board, modelled on the Youth Justice Board, to improve rehabilitation of female offenders.
Reform prisons so they become places of work, rehabilitation and learning, with offenders receiving an education and skills assessment within one week, starting a relevant course and programme of support within one month and able to complete courses on release.
Improve prison governance and accountability
with a new value added measure to assess progress in reducing reoffending, providing education and tackling addiction and mental health issues,
enabling good prisons to earn greater autonomy.
We will strengthen the independence of the Chief Inspectors of Prisons and Probation.
Provide experts in courts and police stations to identify where mental health or a drug problem is behind an offender’s behaviour so they can be dealt with in a way that is appropriate.
We will pilot US-style drug and alcohol courts.
Strengthen the ‘realistic prospect of custody’ test to reduce the use of remand for suspected offenders who can be safely monitored in the community and are unlikely to receive a prison sentence if found guilty.
Liberal Democrats will adopt the default position that – unless there are strong reasons to the contrary in specific cases – public servants rather than commercial organisations should provide detention, prison, immigration enforcement and secure units.
9.6 Ensuring access to justice
Access to justice is an essential part of a free society and a functioning legal system.
In this Parliament we have had to make significant savings from the Legal Aid budget,
but in the next Parliament our priority for delivering efficiency in the Ministry of Justice should be prison and court reform, using technology and innovation to reduce costs.
We will: Review the criminal Legal Aid market and ensure there are no further savings without an impact assessment as to the viability of competitive and diverse market of Legal Aid providers.
Reduce pressure on the criminal Legal Aid budget by requiring company directors to take out insurance against prosecution for fraud and permitting the use of restrained assets to pay reasonable legal bills.
Carry out an immediate review of civil Legal Aid, judicial review and court fees, in consultation with the judiciary, to ensure Legal Aid is available to all those who need it,
that those of modest means can bring applications for judicial review of allegedly unlawful government action
and that court and tribunal fees will not put justice beyond the reach of those who seek it.
This will mean reversing any recent rises in up-front court fees that make justice unaffordable for many, and instead spreading the fee burden more fairly.
Retain access to recoverable success fees and insurance premiums in asbestosis claims
and where an individual is suing the police;
and also for both claimant and defendant in publication and data protection claims, except where one party is significantly better resourced than the other.
Promote the use of alternative buildings for magistrates’ courts and local dispute resolution programmes like Community Justice Panels to bring justice back into the community.
Support innovation like the provision of civil justice online and expansion of alternative dispute resolution procedures.
Encourage the widespread use of mediation for separating couples, while protecting access to the family courts where necessary
Develop a strategy that will deliver advice and legal support to help people with everyday problems like personal debt and social welfare issues, working across government and involving non-profit advice agencies.
9.7 Tackling terrorism and violent extremism
Terrorism and violent extremism remain a serious threat to the United Kingdom, which requires a proportionate response.
We will: Work with religious and community leaders, civil society groups and social media sites to counter the narratives put forward by extremists,
and create the space for the expression of contrary viewpoints and religious interpretations.
Maintain laws that provide an effective defence against terrorist activity, including proscription of terrorist groups,
Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures,
and Temporary Exclusion Orders, which enable the security services to manage the return of those who have fought illegally in foreign conflicts.
Ensure we continue to provide the appropriate resources to the police and intelligence agencies to meet the threat, including of cyber attack.
Ensure efforts to tackle terrorism do not stigmatise or alienate Muslims or any other ethnic or faith group,
and that government supports communities to help prevent those at risk of radicalisation from being drawn into illegal activity.
Review the process of assessing threats against different ethnic and religious communities to ensure all groups in the UK are properly protected.
9.8 An effective approach to reducing drug harm
For too long the debate about effective ways to reduce the harm caused by drugs has been distorted by political prejudice.
Around the world, countries are trialling new approaches that are reducing drug harm, improving lives, reducing addiction and saving taxpayers’ money.
In the UK we have made good progress on treatment but we continue to give 80,000 people a year a criminal record for drug possession, blighting their employment chances,
and we still imprison 1,000 people a year for personal possession when they are not charged with dealing or any other offence.
We will: Adopt the approach used in Portugal where those arrested for possession of drugs for personal use are diverted into treatment, education or civil penalties that do not attract a criminal record.
As a first step towards reforming the system, legislate to end the use of imprisonment for possession of drugs for personal use,
diverting resources towards tackling organised drug crime instead.
Continue to apply severe penalties to those who manufacture, import or deal in illegal drugs, and clamp down on those who produce and sell unregulated chemical highs.
Establish a review to assess the effectiveness of the cannabis legalisation experiments in the United States and Uruguay in relation to public health and criminal activity.
Legislate to make the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs independent in setting the classification of drugs, while remaining accountable to Parliament and the wider public.
Enable doctors to prescribe cannabis for medicinal use.
Put the Department of Health rather than the Home Office in charge of drug policy.
9.9 Restoring confidence in our borders
The UK secures many benefits from immigration, which boosts our economy and helps staff our public services, especially our NHS.
But we need to tackle the weaknesses in our immigration system, which threatened to undermine confidence in it.
That is why we have led work fully to restore border checks on entry and exit.
We need to improve the administration of our system so we deal with asylum claims and visa applications promptly and return those who do not have a valid claim to be in the UK.
Then we can start to rebuild an open, tolerant Britain.
We will: Complete the restoration of full entry and exit checks at our borders, to rebuild confidence in immigration control, and allow targeting of resources at those who overstay their visas.
Speed up the processing of asylum claims, reducing the time genuine refugees have to wait before they can settle into life in the UK and making it easier to remove those who do not have a right to be here.
We will require working age asylum seekers who have waited more than six months for their claim to be processed to seek work like other benefit claimants, and only to receive benefits if they are unable to do so.
We will end the use of the ‘Azure Card’ for administering benefits in the asylum system.
Double the number of inspections on employers to ensure all statutory employment legislation is being respected.
Separate students within official immigration statistics, while taking tough action against any educational institution that allows abuse of the student route into the UK.
Present to Parliament an annual assessment of skill and labour market shortfalls and surpluses and their impact on the economy, public services and local communities,
together with an audit report on the migration control system, allowing full Parliamentary oversight of Britain’s migration policies.
Continue requirements for all new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance (JSA) to have their English language skills assessed, with JSA then being conditional on attending English language courses for those whose English is poor.
Encourage schools with high numbers of children with English as a second language to host English lessons for parents.
People Devolution, democracy and citizenship
For freedom to be meaningful, people need the power not just to make decisions about their own lives, but about the way their country, their community, their workplace and more are run.
Liberal Democrats have made a good start on modernising and decentralising the state.
But we were thwarted in some of our attempts to reform politics.
When it came to reforming the House of Lords
and giving citizens a stronger voice with fair votes, our proposals were blocked.
We still believe these are essential changes and will continue our work to deliver them.
For freedom to be meaningful, people need the power not just to make decisions about their own lives, but about the way their country, their community, their workplace and more are run.
Liberal Democrats have made a good start on modernising and decentralising the state.
We have taken away the Prime Minister’s power to call elections.
We have improved Parliament with more powers for backbenchers and more internal democracy.
We have devolved power to Councils and communities.
We have enacted the biggest transfer of fiscal power from Westminster to Scotland in three hundred years.
We have supported employee democracy and the mutuals movement.
But we were thwarted in some of our attempts to reform politics.
When it came to reforming the House of Lords
and giving citizens a stronger voice with fair votes, our proposals were blocked.
We still believe these are essential changes and will continue our work to deliver them.
A Record of Delivery
Passed a Lobbying Act to introduce a register of consultant lobbyists and curb the influence of special interest money in elections
Fixed term Parliaments, taking away a Prime Minister’s power to call elections when it suits their own party
New powers for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, including more financial devolution than ever before
Devolved £7 billion of funding for transport and economic growth to local areas in England.
A Promise of More
Get big money out of politics with a £10,000 cap on donations as part of wider funding reform
Better democracy with a fair voting system in local government and at Westminster
and votes at 16
Deliver on our promises to Scotland in full,
devolve more powers to Wales,
and work for a shared future in Northern Ireland
Meet the needs of England with Devolution on Demand, letting local areas take control of the services that matter most to them
10.1 Better politics
Unfair votes, overcentralisation of decision-making, the power of patronage and the influence of powerful corporate lobbies mean ordinary citizens and local communities are too often excluded and sidelined in politics today.
We need to reform British politics to make it more representative and more empowering of our citizens so it commands greater public confidence.
We will: Take big money out of politics by capping donations to political parties at £10,000 per person each year,
and introducing wider reforms to party funding along the lines of the 2011 report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, funded from savings from existing government spending on politics.
Protect the rights of trade union members to have their subscriptions, including political levies, deducted from their salary,
and strengthen members’ political freedoms by letting them choose which political party they wish to support through such automatic payments.
We will encourage wider participation in trade union ballots through electronic voting.
Introduce votes at age 16 for elections and referendums across the UK,
and make it easier to register to vote in schools and colleges.
Reform the House of Lords with a proper democratic mandate, starting from the proposals in the 2012 Bill.
Reform our voting systems for elections to local government and Westminster to ensure more proportional representation.
We will introduce the Single Transferable Vote for local government elections in England
and for electing MPs across the UK.
We will reduce the number of MPs but only as part of the introduction of a reformed, fair, voting system.
Cancel the boundary review due to report in 2018.
While new constituencies would need to be established for a new voting system, we believe constituency boundary reviews should respect natural geographical communities, with greater flexibility for the Boundary Commission to deviate from exact equality to take account of community ties and continuity of representation.
Explore options to strengthen and simplify the voting rights of UK citizens living abroad and address disenfranchisement experienced by some.
Work with the broadcasters to formalise the process for Leaders' Debates in General Elections, helping ensure they happen and setting a clear threshold for those eligible to participate.
Strengthen and expand the lobbying register and prohibit MPs from accepting paid lobbying work.
We will consider carefully the work of the independent reviewer into the impact of third party spending regulations to ensure the right balance has been struck.
We will also remove the discrimination against third parties by requiring political parties to include the cost of staffing in their national expense limits in the same way as third parties now do.
To reform Parliament in particular we will: Strengthen the role of MPs in amending the Budget and scrutinising government spending proposals.
Make Parliament more family-friendly, and establish a review to pave the way for MP jobsharing arrangements.
Implement a House Business committee to ensure that Parliament and not the executive decides the Parliamentary timetable, ending the ‘talking out’ of private members’ business.
Building on the Wright Committee recommendations of 2009, and experiences of Coalition, we will conduct a full review of Parliamentary procedures, which should formally recognise individual political parties not just Government and Opposition.
10.2 A decentralised but United Kingdom
Liberal Democrats have a proud record of leading the way on giving greater powers to the nations of the UK.
Liberal Democrat Ministers were the ones to lead the 2012 Scotland Act and the 2014 Wales Act through Parliament, transferring more financial autonomy to Scotland than ever before
and Wales’ first tax powers.
And in the last months, we have given the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the power to lower the voting age to 16.
Now we need go further.
We must deliver on the promises made to the people of Scotland and the rest of the UK to further decentralise power.
In short, we will deliver Home Rule to each of the nations of a strong, federal United Kingdom.
Constitutional change has taken place rapidly.
We now need to make sure all the new arrangements work together coherently and we will therefore establish a UK Constitutional Convention, made up from representatives of the political parties, academia, civic society and members of the public, tasked with producing a full written constitution for the UK, to report within two years.
There are many powers that we think should be devolved on an equal basis to the existing Parliaments and Assemblies.
We will transfer power to: Borrow for investment.
Manage the Crown Estate’s economic assets.
Control a range of benefits for older people, carers and disabled people.
Scotland
After the independence referendum, the Smith Commission brought Scotland’s five main parties together to agree what further powers should be assigned to the Scottish Parliament.
Liberal Democrats ensured the package of powers reflects Scotland’s key priorities.
The Scottish Parliament should raise in tax more than half of what it spends in its budget.
A Scottish welfare system should allow the Scottish Parliament to change the benefits regime where there is specific Scottish need or priority, with a starting budget of around £3 billion.
These powers and more will deliver for the Scottish people: an empowered and accountable Scottish Parliament
in a strong and secure United Kingdom.
We will deliver Home Rule for Scotland by implementing the Smith Commission proposals in full in the first session of the next Parliament.
We will continue to make the case for powers currently held at Westminster and Holyrood to be transferred directly to local government where appropriate.
Wales
We endorse the recent St. David’s Day announcement and will implement it in full, devolving powers over energy, ports, local elections, broadcasting and more, and implementing a reserved powers model.
But this announcement does not go far enough.
Liberal Democrats will go further and deliver proper Home Rule for Wales and a Welsh Parliament by: Implementing the remaining Silk Part 1 proposals on financial powers for Wales.
We will consider the work of the Government’s review on devolution of Air Passenger Duty (APD),
with a view to devolving long-haul APD.
Implementing the Silk Part 2 proposals by: Transferring powers from the UK Parliament to the National Assembly over S4C, sewerage, transport, teachers’ pay, youth justice, policing and in the longer term other justice powers.
Devolving funding of Network Rail in relation to the Wales network.
Strengthening the capacity of the National Assembly to scrutinise legislation and hold the Welsh Government to account.
Allowing the Welsh Government to set its own bank holidays.
Providing for a Welsh Parliament, preventing Westminster from being able to override Wales on devolved matters,
and devolving the power to amend electoral arrangements for the Assembly and local elections in Wales with a two thirds majority.
Giving the Children’s Commissioner for Wales the power to examine issues that affect children in Wales but are not within the control of the Welsh Government.
In addition, to help create jobs and boost growth in Wales, we will abolish the economically distorting tolls on the Severn Bridge once the debts are paid off.
Northern Ireland
Liberal Democrats wish to see a permanently peaceful, stable, non-sectarian
and truly democratic society in Northern Ireland.
We will work constructively with the political parties in Northern Ireland and with the Irish Government to ensure the political stability of the Northern Ireland Assembly and other institutions of the Belfast Agreement.
To grow the economy, tackle social exclusion, overcome inequality and deliver efficiencies in public services, Liberal Democrats will support policies and initiatives that promote sharing over separation and counter the cost of division.
A key aspect of this is dealing with the legacy of the past.
The Stormont House Agreement represents another stage in the intensive work necessary to build long-term peace, stability and prosperity in Northern Ireland.
In Government we delivered on the commitment to enable the devolution of Corporation Tax to Northern Ireland by April 2017.
We will continue to work with all parties to implement the full package of measures in the Stormont House Agreement and address outstanding issues.
We will build on this by: Keeping under review the prospect of further devolution of fiscal powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly
and other powers that would improve the financial accountability of the Assembly.
Promoting a strong mechanism for working constructively with civic society in Northern Ireland.
Working to ensure the interface is smooth and effective between national security and counter-terrorism policing on the one hand, and local policing and criminal justice activities on the other.
Supporting changes to the powers and internal mechanisms of the Northern Ireland Assembly that reinforce the development of normal, democratic principles
and enhances the creation of a shared future beyond sectarianism and division.
Working with the political parties in Northern Ireland to tackle the cost of division and ensuring all Government policies in Northern Ireland support the aim of a genuine Shared Future for all.
England
Devolution of power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has implications for the UK Parliament and its dual role in legislating for England as well as the federal UK.
It is possible that a future UK government could use the support of MPs representing Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland to secure the passage of legislation that only affects England, even if the majority in England were opposed.
This would be a key issue for our proposed Constitutional Convention to address.
Liberal Democrats believe an English-only stage in legislation affecting England should be considered, so English MPs can have a separate say on laws that only affect England.
However, this would need to be on a proportional basis, genuinely reflecting the balance of opinion in England, not the distorted picture generated by the First Past the Post system.
Beyond Parliament, there is much to change to improve the way communities in England are governed.
By returning power to the villages, towns, cities and regions of England we can drive growth, improve public services and give people freedom to run their own lives.
To rejuvenate local government in England, we will: Reduce the powers of Ministers to interfere in democratically elected local government.
Remove the requirement to hold local referenda for Council Tax changes, ensuring Councillors are properly accountable for their decisions by introducing fair votes.
Build on the success of City Deals and Growth Deals to devolve more power and resources to groups of Local Authorities and Local Enterprise Partnerships, starting with back-to-work support.
Establish a Government process to deliver greater devolution of financial responsibility to English Local Authorities, and any new devolved bodies in England, building on the work of the Independent Commission on Local Government Finance.
Any changes must balance the objectives of more local autonomy and fair equalisation between communities.
In some areas of England there is an even greater appetite for powers, but not every part of the country wants to move at the same speed and there cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach.
We will therefore introduce Devolution on Demand, enabling even greater devolution of powers from Westminster to Councils or groups of Councils working together – for example to a Cornish Assembly.
Funding
The nations of the United Kingdom have long had different needs with regard to funding.
The Barnett Formula is the mechanism used to adjust spending allocations across the UK.
The Liberal Democrats have already delivered a substantial extension of financial powers to the nations of the UK and we will devolve further fiscal powers to the devolved governments.
In order to ensure reliable funding, we will retain the Barnett Formula as the basis for future spending allocations for Scotland and Northern Ireland.
This will protect the individual nations’ budgets from external shocks like the recent global drop in the price of oil.
We recognise the findings of the Holtham Commission that the current formula underfunds Wales and will commission work to update this analysis.
We will address the imbalance by immediately entrenching a Barnett floor set at a level that reflects the need for Wales to be funded fairly,
and seek over a Parliament to increase the Welsh block grant to an equitable level.
10.3 Everyday democracy
To lead a fulfilled life, people need power over more than just their government.
Liberal Democrats will spread democracy in everyday life by encouraging mutuals, cooperatives, and employee participation and by increasing the opportunities for people to take democratic control over the services on which they rely.
We will encourage citizens to engage in practical social action, seeing government as an enabler and facilitator rather than just a commissioner and provider of services.
We will: Aim to increase the number of Neighbourhood, Community and Parish Councils and promote tenant management in social housing.
Encourage employers to promote employee participation and employee ownership, aiming to increase further the proportion of GDP in employee-owned businesses.
We will change company law to permit a German-style two-tier board structure to include employees.
Introduce mandatory arbitration for strikes likely to cause widespread public disruption, enabling us to defend workers’ rights to strike while ensuring continued service in essential public services.
Strengthen worker participation in decision-making, including staff representation on remuneration committees, and the right for employees who collectively own 5% of a company to be represented on the board.
Give football fans a greater say in how their clubs are run by encouraging the reform of football governance rules to promote engagement between clubs and supporters.
Support local libraries and ensure any libraries under threat of closure are offered first for transfer to the local community.
Spread mutual structures and employee participation through the public sector.
Strengthen community rights to run local public services, and protect community assets like pubs by bringing forward a Community Right to Buy.
We will ensure planning permission is required to convert a pub into alternative uses.
Support social investment, ensuring charities and social enterprises can access the support and finance they need to develop and deliver innovative, sustainable solutions to challenges in their communities.
10.4 Protecting the space for democratic debate
We recognise the importance of a plural and diverse media, free from state influence or from monopolistic or dominant market control, in guaranteeing a vibrant national conversation.
We will therefore reform the existing arrangements for safeguarding plurality in the media broadly in line with the recommendations of the 2014 Lords Communications Select Committee report.
We will: Give lead responsibility to Ofcom and enable it to conduct reviews periodically, as well as when triggered by proposed mergers and acquisitions,
and enable Ofcom to set down conditions to prevent the reach of any media company damaging the public interest.
Ensure any conditions or requirements that Ofcom lays down following a plurality review can only be vetoed or interfered with by a Minister after a vote of both Houses of Parliament.
Use a variety of measures to ensure that there is a vibrant local and ‘hyperlocal’ media to help inform citizens about their local area and their local politics, including: Redirecting the current subsidies for ‘local TV’, which have failed to contribute significantly to cultural life.
Extending Ofcom’s community radio grant support to online hyperlocals, and allowing non-profit local media outlets to obtain charitable status where the public interest is being served.
Britain in  the world Global action for security and prosperity
In a more globalised, interdependent world, freedom for individuals is not best protected solely by the nation state.
Corporations, banks and markets now operate across the globe with little respect for national borders.
Climate change, one of the greatest challenges of our age, is by its nature global.
And criminals, hackers and terrorists now operate across borders, too.
It is in the interests of all countries to create a system of international law and governance, both treaty-based and multilateral, at the global level.
We will ensure Britain actively and constructively works with our allies and partners in the European Union,
Commonwealth,
UN
and NATO
to engage with and develop policy responses when liberal internationalism and the rules-based system are challenged.
Liberal Democrats are internationalists because we respect the rights of human beings wherever they live and understand that by working together countries can achieve more than they can alone.
This is particularly true for a country like the UK with a rich web of global relationships, which gives it the potential to wield greater influence than its economic or military power alone would permit.
In a more globalised, interdependent world, freedom for individuals is not best protected solely by the nation state.
Corporations, banks and markets now operate across the globe with little respect for national borders.
Climate change, one of the greatest challenges of our age, is by its nature global.
And criminals, hackers and terrorists now operate across borders, too.
It is in the interests of all countries to create a system of international law and governance, both treaty-based and multilateral, at the global level.
Liberal Democrats have worked tirelessly in government to keep Britain at the heart of the European Union, to secure the best deal for British citizens.
Our Ministers have represented the UK across the world on vital issues from climate change
to nuclear disarmament
and secured agreements that will keep us all safer, not least the International Arms Trade Treaty.
We have stood up for human rights,
the rule of international law
and humanitarian aid, delivering for the first time on the 40 year old UN ambition for developed countries to spend 0.7% of national income as Official Development Assistance.
We will ensure Britain actively and constructively works with our allies and partners in the European Union,
Commonwealth,
UN
and NATO to engage with and develop policy responses when liberal internationalism and the rules-based system are challenged.
A Record of Delivery
Increased aid spending to 0.7% of national income, and guaranteed this in law
Secured a record £23.9 billion last year from clamping down on tax evasion, avoidance and fraud,
and won G8 agreement on transparency on the real owners of businesses
Passed a law to guarantee a referendum before Britain passes any more powers to the EU
Agreed an ambitious EU target of 40% cuts to carbon emissions by 2030,
and secured Rio+20 agreements on sustainable development
Supported our armed forces and veterans, enshrining the Armed Forces Covenant in law
A Promise of More
Ensure the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals aim to end poverty, protect the environment and leave no one behind
Improve tax transparency including in low-income countries by extending country-by-country reporting from banks and extractive industries to all UK listed companies
Ensure Britain plays a constructive part in the European Union
and any referendum triggered by the EU Act is on the big question: In or Out
Work to secure a binding global agreement on cutting emissions,
and a stronger commitment within the EU to a 50% reduction by 2030
Focus on ensuring our armed forces have the training and equipment they need for the threats of today
and end continuous nuclear weapon patrols
11.1 Working for peace and security across the world
From the recent collapse of talks between Israelis and Palestinians to Russian interference in Ukraine, this is a challenging time for peace and security across the world.
At times like these we need to redouble our diplomatic efforts
and work closely with our EU
and NATO partners to promote an active, rights-based foreign policy for our mutual defence.
The UK has a proud record of playing a leading role in the European Union
and in international institutions like the UN, NATO
and the Commonwealth
and should continue to do so, wherever possible promoting our values of freedom and opportunity for all.
We will: Use all aspects of government policy – trade, aid and diplomacy
as well as military cooperation// –
to focus UK policy on conflict prevention.
This will require a joint approach across the MOD, FCO, DFID and other departments, and we will continue to assess UK government actions for their impacts on conflict prevention and security.
This will be a priority within the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), which should begin immediately after the election.
Engage with and strengthen multilateral UN and treaty-based institutions worldwide.
Support the UN principle of Responsibility to Protect.
This principle focuses on the security of individuals, rather than states.
Improve control of arms exports by: Implementing a policy of ‘presumption of denial’ for arms exports to countries listed as countries of concern in the Foreign Office’s annual human rights report.
Requiring end-user certification on all future arms export licenses with an annual report to Parliament on this certification.
Should all these institutions and policies fail, we recognise it will be necessary to consider military interventions to protect ourselves
and fulfil our international obligations.
However in these circumstances, Liberal Democrats believe the UK should intervene only when there is a clear legal and/or humanitarian case,
endorsed by a vote in Parliament,
working within the remit of international institutions wherever and whenever possible.
In response to current major conflicts worldwide, we will: Promote democracy and stability in Ukraine and neighbouring countries against an increasingly assertive Russia.
We will work closely with EU and other international partners to exert maximum economic and political pressure on Russia to stop interfering in the affairs of sovereign Eastern European nations,
and will stand by our obligations under the NATO treaty in the event of threats to NATO member states.
We will work with the EU to develop an EU energy strategy that will reduce reliance on Russia’s energy supplies.
Continue to work with international partners – Western, African and Arab – to tackle Islamic fanaticism embodied by organisations like the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Boko Haram in Nigeria.
These extremist organisations pervert Islam and carry out appalling atrocities against Muslims as well as non-Muslims.
This is a generational challenge that will take time and patience.
We favour broadening the international Coalition against IS.
Recognising that airstrikes alone will not defeat IS, continue a comprehensive approach, in compliance with international law, to supporting the Iraqi government in standing against IS,
including: Assistance in strengthening its democratic institutions.
Training the Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters.
Humanitarian relief to help alleviate the suffering of displaced Syrians and Iraqis.
Support the moderate opposition in Syria, who are fighting both President Bashar al-Assad and IS.
We will continue to push for an inclusive political transition in Syria, which would enable Syrian moderates from all sides to unite against extremism and tyranny.
Remain committed to a negotiated peace settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which includes a two-state solution.
We condemn disproportionate force used by all sides.
We condemn Hamas’ rocket attacks and other targeting of Israeli civilians.
We condemn Israel’s continued illegal policy of settlement expansion, which undermines the possibility of a two-state solution.
We support recognition of the independent State of Palestine as and when it will help the prospect of a two-state solution.
Support multilateral negotiations to stop Iran obtaining nuclear weapons.
We will continue to seek normalisation of our diplomatic relations with Iran, including reopening the British Embassy in Tehran
and promoting peaceful dialogue between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
11.2 Our armed forces and security services
The UK must be able to defend itself and the territories for which it has responsibility,
support its neighbours and allies,
and engage in humanitarian intervention.
Many of the security challenges the UK faces are shared by our partners and allies in the EU
and NATO
and the UK is more effective and more resilient when we work closely with those partners.
Liberal Democrats are clear that the security offered by our continued membership of the EU is more crucial than ever,
as are our bilateral relationships with our key European allies.
We favour greater integration of military capabilities and procurement to address common problems, to overcome economic constraints and to maintain a full spectrum of defence capabilities.
To achieve this, we will build on the treaty-based arrangements we have established and extend this cooperation to other suitable European partners.
Liberal Democrats are committed to meeting our national and international obligations in security and defence.
This is why in government over the last five years we met the NATO commitment to spend 2% of our GDP on defence,
most recently restated in the Readiness Action Plan and Defence Industrial Pledge at the Wales NATO Summit in 2014.
We are committed to completing a comprehensive Strategic Defence and Security Review early in the next Parliament to inform future defence spending decisions.
We recognise that the world has changed fundamentally since the last such review.
It is vital that our real security and defence needs and international obligations are considered in the SDSR, and this is why we wish to move towards a Single Security Budget.
We will: Conduct a Strategic Defence and Security Review in which we will revisit and update the Future Force 2020 vision and ensure the capabilities we are invested in are relevant for keeping Britain safe.
Use the SDSR to establish a Single Security Budget, including not just conventional defence spending but the work of our security agencies, cyber defences and soft power interventions.
The Single Security Budget will be distributed by the SDSR process, as part of an overall Spending Review.
This integrated approach will ensure spending choices follow the capabilities we need, not traditional departmental silos.
Maintain strong and effective armed forces and the capability to deploy rapidly expeditionary forces.
Set long-term budgets to invest in the right equipment at competitive prices.
Recognise the expansion of warfare into the cybersphere, by investing in our security and intelligence services and acting to counter cyber attacks.
Remain fully engaged in international nuclear disarmament efforts.
Step down the nuclear ladder by procuring fewer Vanguard successor submarines
and moving from continuous at sea deterrence to a contingency posture of regular patrols,
enabling a surge to armed patrols when the international security context makes this appropriate.
This would help us to fulfil our Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty commitments
and reduce the UK nuclear warhead stockpile.
Work for new global standards to end the use of conventional explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas.
Promote European defence integration where appropriate by enhancing European defence industry co-operation.
Liberal Democrats recognise the vital role the UK’s armed forces play in the defence of the nation and believe that it is the role of government to safeguard the interests of service personnel and veterans.
We strongly support the Armed Forces Covenant, now enshrined in law in the 2011 Armed Forces Act
We also propose: Transferring the Office of the Veterans’ Minister to the Cabinet Office, so that the services of all departments can be marshalled in support of veterans
and creating a post of Veterans’ Commissioner.
Improving support for personnel and veterans with mental health problems, including alcohol dependency.
Strengthening local military covenants by defining more exacting guidelines and ensuring best practice is rolled out across all Local Authorities.
The government in 2011 set a target for increasing the size of the Reserves to 30,000 but it is significantly behind in achieving this goal, with continued problems of retention.
We acknowledge the different pressures that Reserves face and propose that: Emphasis be put on improving retention and training of Reserves at current levels.
Employers be required to offer two weeks’ unpaid leave annually to assist Reserves attending training camps.
11.3 Britain in Europe: prosperity and reform
Britain’s membership of the EU is essential for creating a stronger economy and for projecting influence in the world.
Millions of British jobs are linked to our trade with the EU,
and being in Europe puts us on a more equal footing when negotiating trade deals with global players like the USA and China
and in countering security threats.
A modernised EU is crucial to responding to the global challenges Britain faces, whether they are climate change, cross-border crime and terrorism, or conflict.
If the UK were to leave the EU, trade rules would be made without us,
our voice would not be heard in climate change negotiations
and our borders would be more vulnerable.
There is no doubt the UK would be poorer and weaker if we walked away from our closest neighbours and most trusted allies and left the EU.
But that does not mean that the institutions and policies of the European Union are perfect and do not need reform.
Liberal Democrats are the party of reform whether that is in Westminster, Holyrood, the Senedd or in local Councils and the EU is no exception.
Liberal Democrats in Government have already secured significant reforms like cutting the EU budget by £30 billion
and reforming the Common Fisheries Policy, ending the discarding of usable fish.
We have also shifted the balance of EU spending towards jobs, growth and innovation.
Only by remaining fully engaged in the EU can we deliver the further reforms that are urgently needed not only for the UK, but also for the rest of the EU.
We will: Work to deepen the EU single market in the energy sector,
in the digital economy
and for services.
We will boost British exports by scrapping national barriers to British firms trading online
and by concluding ambitious EU trade agreements with key markets like Japan and India.
We will implement the recommendations made by Michael Moore MP in October 2014, including publishing an annual European Business White Paper and appointing an EU Business Minister to lead this competitiveness agenda.
Support negotiations at the World Trade Organisation
as well as an ambitious Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and the USA,
which could bring benefits of up to £10 billion a year to the British economy.
We will only support an agreement that upholds EU standards of consumer, employee and environmental protection,
and allows us to determine how NHS services are provided.
Work to reform the EU to make it more efficient, reducing the proportion of the EU budget spent on the Common Agricultural Policy,
abolishing unnecessary EU institutions like the European Economic and Social Committee
and scrapping the second seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
Continue to reduce the burden of EU legislation on business by curbing unnecessary red tape,
exempting small businesses from EU rules where possible
and defending the UK opt-out to the Working Time Directive.
Increase the accountability of the EU by enhancing the role of national Parliaments in scrutinising EU decision-making
and by giving a combined majority of national Parliaments the automatic ability to block unwanted legislation.
We will strengthen UK scrutiny of European legislation and positions taken by British Ministers in Europe
including by proposing an explicit role for British Parliamentary Select Committees.
Hold an In/Out referendum when there is next any Treaty change involving a material transfer of sovereignty from the UK to the EU.
Liberal Democrats will campaign for the UK to remain in the European Union when that referendum comes.
Reinforce the EU’s tools for tackling cross border crime,
strengthening the role of the European Cyber Crime Centre
and reforming the European Arrest Warrant to prevent miscarriages of justice
while ensuring swift delivery of justice.
Cooperate with other European countries to address environmental threats and tackle climate change by securing agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030
and developing the EU Energy Union.
Support EU free movement, which is hugely beneficial to millions of British citizens living in other European countries as well as to the British economy and the public sector, for example the thousands of European health workers who make a vital contribution to the running of the NHS.
We will prevent any perceived ‘right to claim’ by tightening benefit rules for EU migrants, including reducing, and ultimately abolishing, payment of Child Benefit to children who are not resident in the UK.
We will also lengthen transitional controls for new EU member countries, and eliminate loopholes.
Cooperate with other European countries to address the pressure of migration across the Mediterranean.
We will push for more effective EU measures to prevent the tragic loss of life for many crossing the Mediterranean, including through greater cooperation with anti-human-trafficking operations.
Continue to work closely with other EU governments on foreign policy issues towards Russia, Ukraine, the Middle East and North Africa.
We will build on our already close defence cooperation with France, the Netherlands, the Nordic states and other European countries, as the most reliable basis for British security.
11.4 International development
In government, Liberal Democrats have led the way on international development and aid.
We have worked to end the use of rape as a weapon of war.
We have led international efforts to tackle the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone
and, through investment in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations (GAVI), Britain is a global leader in preventing communicable diseases.
Now, we need to build on progress made since the agreement of the Millennium Development Goals and work to eliminate absolute poverty by 2030 – through aid but also through economic development.
We will: Develop a whole-government approach to development.
Continue to promote private sector economic development, ensuring this benefits local people and small businesses not just multinational corporations.
We will lead international action to ensure global companies pay fair taxes in the developing countries in which they operate,
including tightening anti-tax haven rules
and requiring large companies to publish their tax payments and profits for each country in which they operate.
Maintain our commitment to spend 0.7% of UK Gross National Income on overseas development, which the International Development Act 2015, introduced by a Liberal Democrat, now enshrines in law.
We will adhere to the OECD’s definition of what activities qualify.
Conduct a full Bilateral and Multilateral Aid Review to ensure that the Department for International Development continues to work in the right places and through the right channels.
Continue building the resilience of poorer countries to resist future disasters, investing in healthcare and infrastructure and training emergency response volunteers,
and respond generously to humanitarian crises wherever they may occur.
Work to ensure the Sustainable Development Goals aim to: Safeguard the sustainability of the planet.
Leave no one behind, helping the most vulnerable as well as improving average living standards.
We will ensure people do not suffer discrimination or disadvantage because of gender, sexual orientation, disability or ethnic origin.
Eliminate absolute poverty by 2030.
Invest to eliminate within a generation preventable diseases like TB, HIV and malaria
and explore new ways to support public and private research and development into treatment for these and other deadly diseases and infections.
Create a new civil society partnership scheme to build links between peoples in rich and poor countries, including partnerships between communities, trade unions or emergency services.
11.5 International action on the environment
The open and internationalist approach Liberal Democrats have always adopted is particularly crucial when it comes to environmental policy.
Pollution does not respect national borders, and wildlife and ecosystems are not constrained by political boundaries.
Challenges like climate change and deforestation are too massive for individual countries to tackle alone.
We will: Continue pushing for a 50% reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions by 2030
and the greater use of EU funds to support low-carbon investments,
while ensuring the UK meets its own climate commitments
and plays a leadership role in efforts to combat climate change.
Work to secure agreement on a global climate treaty at the 2015 UN Climate Conference,
supported by a well-financed Green Climate Fund to assist poorer countries to tackle and adapt to climate change.
Work with regulatory bodies and financial investors to establish a global reporting standard for fossil fuel companies on the potential impact of future restrictions on carbon emissions on their asset base.
Provide greater resources for international environmental cooperation,
particularly on actions to tackle illegal trade in timber, wildlife and fish.
Argue for an EU and global target of halting net global deforestation by 2020
– including supporting better forest law enforcement and governance and sustainable agriculture,
closing loopholes in the EU Timber Regulation
and ensuring that by 2020 only legal and sustainable timber products can be sold in the UK.
Ensure UK and EU development aid, free trade and investment agreements support environmental goals and sustainable investment,
including maintaining the UK’s International Climate Fund
and supporting direct bilateral programmes with developing countries on climate change.
Create a one million square kilometre southern Atlantic Ocean reserve.
Push for the creation of a marine nature reserve in the Arctic Ocean,
promote the highest possible environmental standards for UK companies operating in the region
and press for a ban on EU-flagged vessels undertaking industrial fishing in the previously unfished areas of the Arctic.
11.6  Standing up for Liberal values
Liberal Democrats believe British foreign policy and international aid should seek to advance human rights
and democracy throughout the world.
We believe all people – regardless of ethnicity, disability, age, belief, gender or sexual orientation – deserve a freer, fairer and more prosperous world.
We will: Continue to support free media and a free and open Internet around the world, championing the free flow of information.
Maintain funding to BBC World Service, BBC Monitoring and the British Council.
Develop a comprehensive strategy for promoting the decriminalisation of homosexuality around the world,
and advancing the cause of LGBT+ rights.
Prioritise support, protection and equal rights for women and girls, which is essential for effective, sustainable economic development.
We will pursue an International Gender Equality Strategy,
work to secure women’s rights to education
and freedom from forced marriage;
and aim to end female genital mutilation worldwide within a generation.
Extend existing reporting rules to establish consistent requirements on all large UK companies to report on the social, environmental and human rights impacts of their activities and those of their supply chains.
The recent Islamist extremist attacks on journalists in Europe are a sharp reminder of the need to protect freedom of speech and belief internationally.
We will appoint an Ambassador-level Champion for Freedom of Belief to drive British diplomatic efforts in this field,
and we will campaign for the abolition of blasphemy, sedition, apostasy and criminal libel laws worldwide, having already been responsible for ending them in this country.
