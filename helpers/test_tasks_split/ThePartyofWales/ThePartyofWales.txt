and helping young people get into the industry.
We will make sure letters and parcels cost the same wherever they are sent by keeping the Universal Service Obligation for postal services.

We will ensure that staffing levels of full time and retained fire crews are at an adequate level to provide comprehensive cover in all parts of Wales at all times.
Working for all our people Sustainable Communities
“Plaid Cymru’s vision is for thriving communities across Wales. That means communities that are active, supported by strong local economies, high quality services and good relationships. Communities should be sustainable, investing now in a good quality of life for the future.
Plaid Cymru believes that our communities have the right to make their own decisions.
We will give them the tools to do what is best in all parts of Wales,
to ensure a sustainable and fair country - a community of communities.
Starting with citizens and communities and building outwards is the best way of achieving sustainable communities.
We will develop person-centred, flexible services that are better able to respond to today’s challenges.
Plaid Cymru will set up a Prevention Fund to encourage preventative, integrated working at local level,
and will work to ensure organisations work together in a transparent manner with clear democratic accountability.
We will restructure the Welsh Government’s failed delivery unit to a Strategy and Integration Unit to drive forward long-term crossgovernment issues.
We will use existing third sector structures to ensure a Connected Communities programme - a national community development programme aimed at promoting and supporting community and neighbourhood level action across Wales.
We want to establish a Social Innovation Hub to explore pressing social issues,
creating lines of communication and access between those interested in developing a better society, e.g.better communication between NHS practitioners and patients,

Working for all our people The Welsh language
If we are serious about reversing the decline of the Welsh language, different and more radical steps are necessary. Plaid Cymru has been campaigning hard to improve employment opportunities for Welsh speakers, for instance by ensuring a number of Welsh-language apprenticeships in our budget agreement, but much more needs to be done if we are to support the language to thrive.
Plaid Cymru believes that the Welsh language belongs to everybody in Wales.
We want to see Welsh being used the length and breadth of our country and we will take action so that everybody has the right and opportunity to use Welsh.
Plaid Cymru has worked for Wales
In government we introduced the Welsh Language Measure 2011 which makes Welsh and English the official languages of Wales and created the Welsh Language Commissioner and Welsh language standards.
The purpose of the Welsh language standards is to ensure that Welsh is not treated less favourably than English and that people have the right to use the language.
Unfortunately, due to the Welsh Government dragging its feet, the standards are yet to be introduced.
We will not support the introduction of any standards that are weaker than the current 1993 Welsh Language Act.
Rights
We want to see the Welsh language thrive, with a rights- based approach
allowing speakers to receive Welsh language services in all parts of Wales
and supporting Welsh language communities, wherever they are.
We will ensure that strategies are in place to promote Welsh language education and ensure employment of bilingual people so that these services can be provided across Wales.
We will also introduce tougher regulations for those who fail to meet their statutory commitments to support the Welsh language.
We will support local authorities to work through the medium of Welsh, using the good practice developed by Gwynedd Council.
We will strengthen the Welsh language standards so that all Welsh speakers in Wales have the right to expect a service in their choice of language from public sector bodies and major private sector companies.
We will allow for the empanelling of bilingual juries in Wales.
We will review any legislation which treats Welsh less favourably than English, with particular reference to those relating to major life events, including registration of births, weddings, same- sex partnerships, deaths and cremations
We will ensure that bilingual certificates are available for births and deaths that take place in England to people normally resident in Wales.
We will ensure that service providers located outside Wales meet the same standards of Welsh language provision as those based within Wales when they are contracted to deal with the Welsh public.
We will push for the Welsh language to have official status within the UK Parliament so that meetings of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee and the Welsh Grand Committee can be addressed in either of Wales’ two official languages.
We will press the UK Government to make Welsh an official European Union language
and give Welsh speakers the right to use their language at all levels and for its status to be internationally recognised.
Community Language
Plaid Cymru will provide support for the Welsh language to thrive as a community language and support the use of Welsh in business, education and in the media.
We will ensure that the sustainability of Welsh language communities will be a key part of planning decisions in Wales.
We will use international best practice to set the 2016 Welsh language budget at a level where it can be effective in promoting Welsh as a community language, and protect the budget until the following elections.
We will ensure that Welsh language coverage of the Foundation Phase is improved so that, in time, all pupils will have the opportunity to follow a Welsh language education from the age of 7 onwards.
We will promote the Siarter Iaith which helps schools encourage children to be proud of their Welsh language skills and to use them outside the classroom.
Using the model of the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol in Higher Education, Plaid Cymru will increase the provision of Welsh language courses and tutors in Further Education across Wales, ensuring that vocational subjects are equally available to Welsh speakers in the 14-19 Learning Pathways.
We support establishing a new Welsh language multimediaservice to operate online, on radio and other platforms, in order to reflect the needs of Welsh language audiences and improve current affairs coverage in Wales.
We will legislate to protect traditional Welsh names from being changed and so prevent changes to the linguistic landscape, particularly in traditional Welsh language town centres.
The Welsh language and the economy
We will support a strategy that uses Carmarthen, Aberystwyth and the Menai area as centres for Welsh business, ensuring funding to support businesses across West and NorthWest Wales and helping them to recruit and use the Welsh language in their everyday business.
We will develop a bespoke strategy to support Welsh speakers to become entrepreneurs and develop their own businesses.
We will build on the Plaid Cymru Budget deal of 2012 to deliver more apprenticeships at all levels through the medium of Welsh,
and help companies who work through Welsh.
Working for all our people Working for a Fairer Wales
Plaid Cymru want a Wales in which everybody has the opportunity to reach their potential and make their own life choices.
To achieve this, we will aim to reduce the gap in terms of equality of opportunity and life-chances that currently exist in Wales.
Plaid Cymru is committed to human rights.
We are a party that celebrates diversity and wants to create a fair and equal society in which difference is respected.
We believe that everybody, regardless of their characteristics or background, has a place in Wales’ future.
Disability
We will work with local authorities to ensure that all schools have appropriate access for physically disabled pupils.
We will work with local authorities to ensure that all Blue Badge holders have access to free parking.

We will provide greater opportunities for disabled people to find jobs across Wales through our proposals for a new Welsh job- search service.
We will help families with disabled children to be able to afford child care
and improve the availability of childcare for children with disabilities.
Mental Health
We will encourage employers to provide adequate support for staff experiencing mental health difficulties.
In order to help prisoners with mental health and drug or alcohol problems we will improve cooperation between the prison service and health and substance misuse services.
Older people
If older people wish to find work after reaching pensionable age then they should be supported to do so and we will work with employers to ensure this.
We will work with third sector organisations and the Police to prevent the exploitation of older people through various forms of ‘scams’.
The elderly and vulnerable people must be treated with understanding and respect.
We will improve on the methods and frequencies of inspections of the care provided in hospitals, care homes and nursing homes to ensure this.
We will work to tackle the growing problem of isolation and loneliness among older people by ensuring that community workers are able to spend more time with older people than is currently the case.
We will provide opportunities for older people to remain socially, physically and mentally active into later life.
We will protect the free bus pass service that helps older people travel safely in their communities.
LGBTLesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender
We will ensure that all schools and local authorities record incidents of homophobic bullying and seek to eradicate it by providing support and training to teachers, building on work that Plaid Cymru has already carried out.
This will help them to better identify victims and act appropriately in cases of LGBT bullying in schools.
We will end the twelve month ban on blood donation by gay and bisexual men.
We will provide support wherever possible to tackle isolation and provide safe spaces for individuals and groups.
We will toughen sentencing on homo, bi and transphobic hate crime and work closely with police authorities to ensure widespread recording.
We will work towards the implementation of a framework for Primary Care Service for Trans and Intersex people and the development of a Gender Identity Clinic in Wales.
Tackling Discrimination and Abuse
We will work closely with the Equality and Human Rights Commission and Race Equality to raise awareness and prevent discrimination in terms of access to employment.
We will increase the opportunity for restorative justice, where the face to face meeting of victim and perpetrator of abuse is considered to be an effective way to prevent further offending.
Gender inequalities
We will ensure that men and women are paid the same for comparable work.
We recognise the impact of segregated workspaces where women and men follow different career paths and the effect of this upon wage levels.
We will aim to raise the status of work often carried out by women and promote women’s access to careers in science, technology, engineering, mathematics andother careers where women are under-represented, providing mentors and support networks.
We will aim to provide additional support for young women to enter the job market at an appropriate level through our Welsh JobCentre Plus proposals,
especially helping young or single mothers to access work and reach their potential.
We will provide an extra year of early-years education which will allow parents to choose to work and provide financially accessible child care in order to enable women to work.
We will aim to provide flexible and affordable childcare, particularly in deprived areas,
through the Welsh language
and for children with disabilities.
We will work towards improving facilities and qualifications for childcare and older persons’ care, including social enterprises and co-operatives,
recognising that caring duties fall predominantly upon women.
We will ensure a Living Wage, which will particularly help women who are in low-paid or part-time work and allow them greater financial independence.
Recognising that the impact of austerity has been greater upon women, Plaid Cymru will insist that further cuts include equality impact assessments to prevent disproportionate disadvantage falling upon any particular groups.
We will ensure that all substantially government funded bodies or agencies include at least 40% membership of both men andwomen on their management board.
They should also have a gender awareness plan to achieve appropriate gender balance at all levels, particularly in gender segregated workplaces.
We want both our young women and our young men to be equally successful in their further education, and we will therefore ensure that training for providers ofeducational, training and careers services includes an improved understanding of the effect of gender on learning and how this can be tackled.
Plaid Cymru will remove VAT from women’s sanitary protection products, making the argument for this in Westminster and in Europe.
Working for a more Successful Wales
We know here in Wales that our country is a fabulous place to holiday. From the stunning coastline to the scenic villages and the ancient monuments, there really is something for everyone. The challenge now is to get that message spread far and wide to tourists for whom Wales is not on the radar as a holiday destination. We could be generating much more money for our economy with more investment. Plaid Cymru want to make the most of our country’s natural beauty and show some real support to our tourist industry.
Plaid Cymru wants Wales to be recognised internationally as a successful country.
We want a strong, well-known brand to attract more visitors to Wales,
creating more jobs across the country.
Brand Wales and Tourism
Visit Britain has failed to promote Wales within the UK and abroad.
We will double the budget for Welsh tourism.
Plaid Cymru will support the Welsh hosting of major international events.
We will ensure that they are supported by a strong business case which will demonstrate the benefits to Wales of bringing events such as the Commonwealth Games or a World Expo to the country.
We will hold a Celebrate Wales year to stimulate tourism across the country, similar to ‘Homecoming’ events in Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
Wales has fewer bank holidays than any other European Union country.
Plaid Cymru will make St David’s Day, or the nearest appropriate weekday, a public bank holiday in Wales.
We will support tourism by cutting tourism VAT
which will create 7,000 jobs in Wales.
We will support food festivals across Wales, which invest in local produce and attract tourists
Sport
We will promote sports, exercise and activity for all age groups, genders, abilities as a means of maintaining individual health and wellbeing, recognizing the overall benefits this provides.
Following our excellent performance in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, it is crucial that the momentum is maintained at leisure, intermediate and elite level sport in Wales.
We will continue to develop Plaid Cymru’s Inspire Wales programme to involve all ages in sporting activity and ensure our people stay fit and healthy.
We want to see sport and fitness activities available to everyone in many different types of locations around Wales.
This could include community centres, schools and colleges, and not just leisure centres or dedicated specialist sporting arenas.
Learning from Ireland’s Local Sports Partnerships, we will look to deliver sporting participation regionally across Wales, linking between Welsh governing bodies, sports authorities, local authorities,schools, sports clubs and leisure centres to ensure communities have the relevant sports and leisure facilities for their needs.
By familiarising young people and their families with different types of sports and activities, we hope to see more people taking part in sports, with subsequent beneficial effects upon health and wellbeing.
We think schools have an important role in promoting this, as well as volunteer and council-led organisations outside school.
Although we will promote fitness and activity at all ages, we will design particular schemes to encourage teenage girls to take part in fitness programmes.
In developing our Inspire Wales programme, we want elite athletes to play a role in promoting sport across Wales, visiting schools, youth clubs and Summer events to inspire others to take part,
including people of all abilities from all social, ethnic and economic backgrounds.
We will look into attracting the Tour de France to Wales, for both women and men.
We want to see a Welsh international cricket team that can compete in ICC events.
We will support the development of grassroots sports in every part of Wales,
promoting Welsh national leagues where sporting development allows,
and supporting existing structures, such as the Welsh Premier Football League.
Working for all our people Arts, Media & Culture
Plaid Cymru wants everybody in Wales to access our arts, media and culture.
We want a vibrant and exciting scene, full of quality, innovation and originality, helping to create and represent all facets of Welsh life.
Plaid Cymru has worked for Wales
As part of the One Wales Government, Plaid Cymru ensured the creation of an English-language National Theatre Wales, which has won many awards since its formation.
We also supported the development and improvement of the St Fagans National History Museum, so that it remains one of Europe’s foremost heritage attractions and continues its vital role in explaining Welsh history.
Plaid Cymru supported S4C to maintain its editorial independence and funding when under threat from the UK government.
As a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, Former Plaid Cymru MP Adam Price exposed alleged phone hacking by the News of the World.
Media
We will devolve broadcasting to Wales and implement recommendations on broadcasting made by Plaid Cymru to the Silk Commission.
These include establishing a BBC Trust for Wales as part of a more federal BBC within the UK.
Trustees would be appointed by the Welsh Government and the appointment process including public hearings held by the National Assembly for Wales.
Responsibility for S4C, the world’s only Welsh language channel, would transfer to the National Assembly for Wales, as would the funding for the channel that is currently with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
We will ensure that S4C is adequately funded and that the channel maintains editorial independence.
Again, the Welsh Government should appoint the board members of the S4C Authority following public hearings.
We support establishing a new Welsh language multimedia service to operate online, on radio and other platforms, in order to reflect the needs of Welsh language audiences and improve current affairs coverage in Wales.
Ofcom’s office in Wales shouldhave greater powers, including the authority to take licensing decisions.
The members of Ofcom’s Advisory Committee for Wales should be appointed by the Welsh Government.
This would be best achieved by the federalisation of the work of Ofcom in a UK context.
We will give local newspapers the status of ‘community assets’ so that owners could not close them without communities having the opportunity to keep their paper.
It is important for there to be a plurality of opinions and information sources.
We will oppose any reduction in Welsh produced news and non-news content in our media.
Arts, heritage and culture
Plaid Cymru will introduce a right for everybody to have access to the arts, heritage and culture.
They must be presented so that they are relevant and available to all.
We will increase access to the arts for young people, particularly those of disadvantaged backgrounds,
through promotion of apprenticeships in media and the arts,
and promote the arts to families to participate together.
We will ensure that free access to National Museum Wales continues.
Building on the success of the Dylan Thomas centenary, we will hold a poll to agree on figures of importance in the world of writing in Wales that we can celebrate through holding national events to increase interest in literature.
In 2016, we will celebrate the life and works of Roald Dahl on the centenary of his birth.
We will support Cardiff to become the European City of Culture, and use this as an opportunity to promote the culture of Cardiff and the whole of Wales.
Develop closer links with organisations in Scotland and across Ireland to promote our cultures will be developed.
We will create apprenticeships in the field of historical documentation and culture so that staff skills, knowledge and experiences are retained and nurtured.
We will retain the Royal Commission on Ancient Monuments as a body outside of government
and start a review of the listing process in Wales to ensure that all heritage is protected, with a greater focus on industrial and more recent heritage.
"" Wales does not have to be poor. It is not inevitable that our economy has to be weak. We will not accept that this is as good as it gets. This is why Plaid Cymru’s aim is to create a fairer, greener and more prosperous Wales. ”
