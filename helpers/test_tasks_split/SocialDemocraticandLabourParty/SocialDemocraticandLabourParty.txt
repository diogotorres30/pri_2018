We have a huge wealth of cultural talent in Ireland built on a rich creative and artistic heritage.
Many Northern Irish poets, novelists, musicians and actors are world renowned.
Belfast Councillors Claire Hanna and Nichola Mallon were responsible for the recent bestowing upon Michael Longley the freedom of his native Belfast.
The SDLP believe that the arts sector here needs to be protected in the wake of unprecedented pressures on the budget caused by a DUP and Sinn Féin led austerity agenda.
Alongside the protection of our cultural identity, there are sound economic reasons to protect the arts long term.
Every £1 invested by the Arts Council generates a return of £3 for the local economy.
The SDLP believe that instead of cutting arts funding and reducing creative opportunities as a result, we should nurture local talent in order to develop a sustainable indigenous creative industry.
The SDLP recognise the unique role that sport in general plays within communities in the contex of health promotion, tackling social exclusion, crime and underachievement.
The SDLP continues to promote the Irish language and proposes the establishment of an Irish Language Act to preserve and encourage the language.
It is imperative that a rightsbased Act supports speakers in the freedom to use the language in public life, without constraints.
The SDLP support a comprehensive Irish Language Act based on a rightsoriented approach and which officially recognises the Irish language
and confers valuable rights for speakers of the language in various fields:  political institutions, local government, the justice system education, and the media;
The SDLP believe that an Irish Language Act should apply in Westminster to ensure that particular powers that Westminster has retained, such as broadcasting, are covered by the Act.
Continued funding from the Council to support parents in Irish Medium Educationdevelopment.
Funding for permanent buildings available for the Irishmedium preschool sector.
Funding for ongoing support for the development of Irish Medium preschool sector.
Development of courses for Englishmedium schools.
Continuous training for Irish teachers in schools.
Provision of textbooks, software and on line facilities for schools which are suited to the abilities and ages of the students.
Appropriate provision for the teaching of Irish as a subject for secondary school students who received their education (or some of their education) through Irish.
That the Irish language is fully recognised in the Bill of Rights.
That more funding is made available for a dedicated film and television fund;
That more funding be made available to help with the development of the languagethroughout Ireland.
That the availability of RTÉ and TG4 is extended, which will support the development and success of the medium in the digital age.
The SDLP support a comprehensive Irish Language Act
! Northern Ireland that works
The last few years have seen a return to crisis after crisis.
Political instability is putting investors off, preventing the tough decisions from being made and preventing progress being made on a broad range of issues.
The SDLP has always offered more than sectarian tribal politics.
We want to see devolution deliver for the people of Northern Ireland.
Political instability is putting investors off
The SDLP will continue its campaign to extend the powers available to the people of the North.
We will continue to fight for the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and its commitments on human rights, equality, victims, community relations, the Irish language and NorthSouth cooperation.
As well as full fiscal powers the SDLP will demand the extension of further powers to Northern Ireland including:
Broadcasting, telecommunications and the internet
Aviation
Foreshore and seabed resource rights
National insurance and minimum wage
Energy and minerals resources
Drug policy
Local elections
Lottery spending
Consumer protection
The SDLP is committed to promoting equality, social justice and reconciliation, and to protecting human rights.
These principles are not just slogans, they are a part of our founding philosophy.
We are proud to stand up for the rights of all in our society regardless of sex, race, ethnic or social origin, language, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.
The SDLP has voted in favour of equal marriage and will continue to work tirelessly to make Northern Ireland a progressive and inclusive place to live.
The SDLP has long campaigned for and supported the rights of people from across Europe and beyond who now live and work in the North.
The SDLP celebrate the fact that Northern Ireland is an increasingly diverse society.
Unfortunately hate crimes and racist attacks occur much too often, threatening any attempts to build a fully inclusive and shared society.
OFMdFM have finally consulted on the longoverdue Racial Equality Strategy, which has not been updated since 2005.
The SDLP will fight for robust race equality laws that will allow everyone in Northern Ireland to feel safe in their own homes and communities.
The SDLP will continue our sustained lobbying for a strong Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.
We remain convinced that a Bill of Rights can support the common ground that does exist in our society, and provide protections and principles upon which we can agree despite our differences.
On such common ground we can build a truly shared future.
The SDLP is committed to a united, reconciled and just Ireland.
The Good Friday Agreement established the democratic basis for unity and by providing the public with a credible and achievable vision, we believe, we are the only party, credibly placed, to bring about unity among the people of Ireland.
A prosperous Northern Ireland will be confident and selfassured and this is the only route to a reconciled, just new Ireland.
The SDLP envisages unity as a merger between two equal partners.
In a united Ireland we see the continuation of a Stormont Assembly and we see the same rights and protections that the SDLP delivered as part of the Good Friday Agreement applying in support of minorities in a new allisland arrangement.
In the SDLP’s new Ireland we will see the same level of public services, in the provision of health and education and support for the most vulnerable.
Northern Ireland’s economy is intertwined with the European Union.
The total funding received from Europe amounts to over £7.5 billion including £2.7 billion for farmers and fishermen.
The SDLP is the only major proEuropean party in Northern Ireland.
Membership of the European Union has allowed for a cultural enrichment,
access for Northern Ireland’s producers to a market of 500 million people
and access to funds and support which run into the billions.
The EU enabled the free flow of people, of ideas, of trade and opportunity right across this island, between these islands and across the European continent.
While the North’s global trade grows, our biggest and most established export markets (excluding Britain) are the Republic of Ireland and the EU.
In the current global climate established markets are critical.
Our businesses can only gain from access to the vast and growing EU market.
It is evident in both the North and South of the island that EU membership has provided significant investment flows.
If this was put in jeopardy it would be our people who would lose out, our farmers, businesses, border areas and areas of need.
We have already seen the economic damage done by the threats of a British exit.
Should these threats become a reality much of the progress made in Northern Ireland would be reversed, and the work to build a better future for all made more difficult.
The character of Irish farming has not been understood by the British Government.
Our farmers stand to gain much more within Europe than outside.
Importantly, our young people stand to benefit from guaranteed job placements or training if we implement the European youth employment scheme.
The SDLP were instrumental in keeping the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) on the agenda.
The SDLP was instrumental in the campaign to implement a tougher regime on controlled foreign companies to restrict tax abuse by large corporations in the developing world.
The SDLP has voted against the replacement of the UK’s nuclear weapons system
and in favour of redirecting the money spent on this into health, education and welfare.
The SDLP has consistently supported those working for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.
We are proud to be the first Irish party to vote in favour of recognising an independent and viable Palestinian state.
The SDLP has voted against reckless British military interventions in Libya and Syria.
We will continue to lead the way in protecting our local economy and the peace process by doing all we can to keep the North within the European Union.
