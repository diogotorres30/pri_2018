It’s your money, you worked hard for it – and you should be able to pass it onto your loved-ones
Stronger together: a Union for the 21st century
Our commitment to you:
Wherever you live in the great nations of our United Kingdom, we are on your side.
We will: give English MPs a veto over matters only affecting England, including on Income Tax
honour in full our commitments to Scotland to devolve extensive new powers
implement the agreed settlement for Wales, handing over more responsibility to the Welsh Assembly
continue to build a Northern Ireland where politics works, the economy grows and society is strong.
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – ours is the greatest union of nations the world has ever seen.
Together we have done so much, and we can do much more.
The Conservative Party is the party of the Union – and we will always do our utmost to keep our family of nations together.
It was right to create the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, but the job was not finished.
Without the ability to raise money, the devolved Parliaments were not accountable to taxpayers.
Without devolution to local councils and communities, power felt as distant as ever.
And one fundamental unfairness remains today: Scottish MPs are able to cast the decisive vote on matters that only affected England and Wales, while English and Welsh MPs cannot vote on matters that only affect Scotland.
This leaves a space for resentment to fester – and put our Union in jeopardy.
We have tackled the problems we inherited.
First, we held the referendum on Scottish independence.
It was the right thing to do, and the question of Scotland’s place in the United Kingdom is now settled.
We have made the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly responsible for funding more of what they spend.
We have agreed with Northern Ireland’s parties a deal to help ensure that politics works, the economy grows and society is more cohesive and united.
And we have set out clear plans for English votes for English laws.
All this reflects a core Conservative belief: power to the people.
Around Britain you can see that principle in practice.
In town halls, councillors now have more of a say over public spending.
In communities, local people have the right to vote in referendums on council tax rises.
Neighbourhoods are deciding what is built in their area and what happens to assets such as parks and public buildings.
We believe in giving power to hardworking taxpayers, letting you decide on the issues that affect you and your family
Our commitment to the Union means we want to strengthen it.
We will let local people have more say on local planning and let them vote on local issues.
We will not let anyone impose artificial regions on England – our traditional towns, boroughs, cities and counties are here to stay.
We will continue devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales, and implement the Stormont House Agreement in Northern Ireland.
And we will give English MPs a veto over English-only matters, including on Income Tax – answering the West Lothian Question.
In the last five years, we have proven that we are the party of the Union.
We will go further in the next Parliament, pushing power out beyond Westminster, Cardiff Bay, Holyrood and Stormont, so we keep our United Kingdom strong and secure for the long term.
Our plan of action:
We will build an enduring settlement for the United Kingdom
We will work to ensure a stable constitution that is fair to the people of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
We will strengthen and improve devolution for each part of our United Kingdom in a way that accepts that there is no one-size-fits-all solution:
we will implement the Smith Commission and St David’s Day Agreement or equivalent changes in the rest of the UK, including English votes for English laws.
We will give English MPs a veto over matters only affecting England
We will maintain the Westminster Parliament as the UK and England’s law-making body.
But we want Parliament to work in a way that ensures decisions affecting England, or England and Wales, can only be taken with the consent of the majority of MPs representing constituencies in England, or in England and Wales.
We will end the manifest unfairness whereby Scotland is able to decide its own laws in devolved areas, only for Scottish MPs also to be able to have the potentially decisive say on similar matters that affect only England and Wales.
We will maintain the integrity of the UK Parliament by ensuring that MPs from all parts of the UK continue to deliberate and vote together, including to set overall spending levels.
But we will: change parliamentary procedures so that the detail of legislation affecting only England or England and Wales will be considered by a Committee drawn in proportion to party strength in England or England and Wales.
add a new stage to how English legislation is passed; no bill or part of a bill relating only to England would be able to pass to its Third Reading and become law without being approved through a legislative consent motion by a Grand Committee made up of all English MPs, or all English and Welsh MPs.
extend the principle of English consent to financial matters such as how spending is distributed within England and to taxation – including an English rate of Income Tax – when the equivalent decisions have been devolved to Scotland.
We will honour in full our commitments to Scotland
A new Scotland Bill will be in our first Queen’s Speech and will be introduced in the first session of a new Parliament.
We will implement the recommendations of the Smith Commission so that more than 50 per cent of the Scottish Parliament’s budget will be funded from revenues raised in Scotland
and it will have significant new welfare powers to complement existing devolved powers in health and social care.
We will provide the Scottish Parliament with one of the most extensive packages of tax and spending powers of any devolved legislature in the world.
We will retain the Barnett Formula as the basis for determining the grant to cover that part of the Scottish Parliament’s budget not funded by tax revenues raised in Scotland.
We will agree new rules with the Scottish Government for how the block grant will be adjusted, to take account of the new devolved tax and welfare powers.
And we will ensure that where responsibility for taxation has been devolved, tax changes only affect public spending in that part of the country.
We will implement Wales’ devolution settlement
We will clarify the division of powers between Wales and the UK Government.
We will: devolve to the Welsh Assembly control over its own affairs– including the Assembly name, size and electoral system, Assembly elections and voting age.
implement other recommendations of the second Silk Report where there is all-party support as set out in the St David’s Day Agreement;
this will include devolving to the Welsh Assembly important economic powers over ports and energy consents.
introduce a new Wales Bill if these changes require legislation.
continue to reserve policing and justice as matters for the UK Parliament.
introduce a ‘funding floor’ to protect Welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on Income Tax powers in the next Parliament.
make the Welsh Government responsible for raising more of the money it spends so the Welsh people can hold their politicians to account.
We will continue to build a Northern Ireland where politics works, the economy grows and society is strong
We will maintain Northern Ireland’s position within the United Kingdom on the basis of the consent of its people.
Our strong support for the political institutions established over the past two decades as a result of the various Agreements will continue.
We will : develop and implement our strategy to combat terrorism,
giving the strongest possible support to the brave men and women of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.
work to implement fully and faithfully the historic Stormont House Agreement to enable devolution to function more effectively;
to deal with the legacy of the past;
and to make progress on divisive issues such as flags and parading.
continue to work closely with the Northern Ireland Executive to implement commitments in the 2013 economic pact to rebalance the economy and to build a more united and stronger society.
complete the devolution of Corporation Tax powers to the Assembly, consistent with the Executive fulfilling its commitments on finance, welfare reform and efficiencies in the Stormont House Agreement.
Real change in our relationship with the European Union
Our commitment to you:
For too long, your voice has been ignored on Europe.
We will: give you a say over whether we should stay in or leave the EU, with an in-out referendum by the end of 2017
commit to keeping the pound and staying out of the Eurozone
reform the workings of the EU, which is too big, too bossy and too bureaucratic
reclaim power from Brussels on your behalf and safeguard British interests in the Single Market
back businesses to create jobs in Britain by completing ambitious trade deals and
reducing red tape.
The EU needs to change.
And it is time for the British people – not politicians – to have their say.
Only the Conservative Party will deliver real change and real choice on Europe, with an in-out referendum by the end of 2017.
Labour failed to give you a choice on the EU.
They handed over major new powers to Brussels without your consent, and gave away £7 billion of the British rebate.
We have taken action in Europe to promote your economic security.
We cut the EU budget for the first time ever, saving British taxpayers £8.15 billion.
We took Britain out of Eurozone bailouts, including for Greece
– the first ever return of powers from Brussels.
Our Prime Minister vetoed a new EU treaty that would have damaged Britain’s interests.
And we have pursued a bold, positive, pro-business agenda,
exempting smallest businesses from red tape,
promoting free trade,
and pushing to extend the Single Market to new sectors, like digital.
We believe in letting the people decide: so we will hold an in-out referendum on our
the end of 2017
But there is much more to do.
The EU is too bureaucratic and too undemocratic.
It interferes too much in our daily lives, and the scale of migration triggered by new members joining in recent years has had a real impact on local communities.
We are clear about what we want from Europe.
We say: yes to the Single Market.
Yes to turbo-charging free trade.
Yes to working together where we are stronger together than alone.
Yes to a family of nation states,
all part of a European Union
– but whose interests, crucially, are guaranteed whether inside the Euro or out.
No to ‘ever closer union.’
No to a constant flow of power to Brussels.
No to unnecessary interference.
And no, of course, to the Euro,
to participation in Eurozone bail-outs
or notions like a European Army.
It will be a fundamental principle of a future Conservative Government that membership of the European Union depends on the consent of the British people
– and in recent years that consent has worn wafer-thin.
That’s why, after the election, we will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in Europe,
and then ask the British people whether they want to stay in the EU on this reformed basis or leave.
David Cameron has committed that he will only lead a government that offers an in-out referendum.
We will hold that in-out referendum before the end of 2017 and respect the outcome.
So the choice at this election is clear: Labour and the Liberal Democrats won’t give you a say over the EU.
UKIP can’t give you a say.
Only the Conservative Party will deliver real change in Europe
– and only the Conservatives can and will deliver an in-out referendum.
Our plan of action:
We will let you decide whether to stay in or leave the EU
We will legislate in the first session of the next Parliament for an in-out referendum to be held on Britain’s membership of the EU before the end of 2017.
We will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the EU.
And then we will ask the British people whether they want to stay in on this basis, or leave.
We will honour the result of the referendum, whatever the outcome.
We will protect Britain's economy
We will protect our economy from any further integration of the Eurozone.
The integration of the Eurozone has raised acute questions for non-Eurozone countries like the United Kingdom.
We benefit from the Single Market and do not want to stand in the way of the Eurozone resolving its difficulties.
Indeed, given the trade between Britain and the Eurozone countries we want to see these economies returning to growth.
But we will not let the integration of the Eurozone jeopardise the integrity of the Single Market or in any way disadvantage the UK.
We will reclaim powers from Brussels
We want to see powers flowing away from Brussels, not to it.
We have already taken action to return around 100 powers, but we want to go further.
We want national parliaments to be able to work together to block unwanted European legislation.
And we want an end to our commitment to an ‘ever closer union,’ as enshrined in the Treaty to which every EU country has to sign up.
Furthermore, we will continue to ensure that defence policy remains firmly under British national control,
maintaining NATO and the transatlantic relationship as the cornerstones of our defence and security policy.
David Cameron vetoed a new EU Treaty that would have damaged Britain’s interests – the first time in history that a British Prime Minister has done so
We will scrap the Human Rights Act
We will scrap Labour's Human Rights Act and introduce a British Bill of Rights which will restore common sense to the application of human rights in the UK.
The Bill will remain faithful to the basic principles of human rights, which we signed up to in the original European Convention on Human Rights.
It will protect basic rights, like the right to a fair trial, and the right to life, which are an essential part of a modern democratic society.
But it will reverse the mission creep that has meant human rights law being used for more and more purposes, and often with little regard for the rights of wider society.
Among other things the Bill will stop terrorists and other serious foreign criminals who pose a threat to our society from using spurious human rights arguments to prevent deportation.
We will take action in Europe to make  you better off
We want an EU that helps Britain move ahead, not one that holds us back.
We have already succeeded in exempting our smallest businesses from new EU regulations,
and kicked-off negotiations for a massive EU trade deal with the USA, which could be worth billions of pounds to the UK economy.
We will build on this.
We want to preserve the integrity of the Single Market, by insisting on protections for those countries that have kept their own currencies.
We want to expand the Single Market, breaking down the remaining barriers to trade and ensuring that new sectors are opened up to British firms.
We want to ensure that new rules target unscrupulous behaviour in the financial services industry,
while safeguarding Britain as a global centre of excellence in finance.
So we will resist EU attempts to restrict legitimate financial services activities.
We will press for lower EU spending,
further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and Structural Funds,
and for EU money to be focused on promoting jobs and growth.
A Britain standing tall in the world
Our commitment to you:
Everything we do around the world will be driven by a determination to protect your security and help you prosper.
We will: ensure Britain is a major player on the world stage,
using diplomacy to protect your interests, uphold British values
and tackle threats to your security and prosperity
help generate new trade, investment and job opportunities, to benefit you and your family
maintain our world class Armed Forces so they continue to guarantee your security
uphold our commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income on international development.
Economic security and national security are two sides of the same coin.
Without one, you cannot have the other.
Our prosperity depends upon Britain remaining an active, outward-looking nation, one that is engaged with the world, not looking in on itself.
We will maintain Britain’s strong global role and our capacity to project British power and values around the world.
We want a strong, secure and stable country
Labour’s Great Recession weakened Britain on the world stage.
They left a £38 billion black hole in the defence budget,
went 12 years without conducting a Strategic Defence Review,
and, at times, failed to provide our Armed Forces with the equipment they needed in Afghanistan.
They shut down over 30 British diplomatic missions,
failed to plan properly for Iraq’s reconstruction,
ignored trade and investment opportunities overseas,
and neglected vital relationships.
We have strengthened Britain’s influence in the world.
The National Security Council that we established ensures proper, strategic decision-making at the top of government.
We have boosted exports to emerging markets,
opened new diplomatic posts in Africa, Asia and Latin America,
and led the world in promoting women’s rights and tackling sexual violence in conflict.
We have balanced the defence budget
and set out a clear strategy to defend our nation for the long term.
We and our allies face major challenges:
Islamist extremism, an aggressive Russia, economic uncertainty in the Eurozone, nuclear proliferation and infectious diseases.
A Conservative Government will tackle these challenges.
We will use our membership of NATO,
the EU,
the Commonwealth,
our UN Security Council seat,
our Special Relationship with the USA,
our intelligence agencies,
vital institutions like the BBC World Service and British Council,
and the strong personal links between our diaspora communities and other countries, to achieve the best for Britain.
Only with a strong economy can we maintain our world-class Armed Forces and
We will back this up with UK military power
and international aid.
Our long-term economic plan will ensure we have the economic strength to maintain our world-class Armed Forces,
to uphold our national security
and project power globally.
Aid helps prevent failed states from becoming havens for terrorists.
It builds long-term markets for our businesses,
by promoting global prosperity,
and reduces migration pressures.
So we will maintain our commitment to tackling conflict, poverty and disease around the world.
A stronger voice for our nation on the world stage
Our plan of action:
We will keep you secure
We will tackle global terrorism and the poisonous ideology of Islamist extremism
while taking a patient, long-term approach to preventing conflict and state failure.
We will work with our partners to address threats to UK security,
including the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,
pandemic diseases,
the illegal drugs trade,
piracy and organised crime.
We will: work for peace, stability and an inclusive settlement in Syria and Iraq;
and pursue a comprehensive political and military strategy to defeat ISIL
uphold the sovereignty, integrity and capacity of Ukraine,
and continue to reject Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea
stand shoulder to shoulder with our NATO allies,
reassuring all its members – especially those closest to Russia – of their security,
and continue to support the Euro-Atlantic path for Western Balkan nations
ensure that the significant achievements of our Armed Forces in Afghanistan are maintained;
and support the Government of Afghanistan in ensuring that the country remains stable and never again becomes a haven for international terrorists
support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
robustly defending the right of Israel to protect its security,
while continuing to condemn illegal settlement building, which undermines the prospects for peace
protect global security by helping to lead international efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon;
and work to ensure that North Korea ends its development of nuclear weapons.
We will help make you better off
Over the last five years, we have used foreign policy to boost our prosperity.
UK exports to China have more than doubled since 2009.
We will do more, using the new embassies and diplomatic posts we have opened to connect Britain to the fastest-growing economies in the world.
We will push for freer global trade,
concluding major trade deals with the US,
India and Japan
and reinvigorating the World Trade Organisation.
As part of our drive to attract more investment into the UK and increase British exports,
we will:  build on our strong relationship with India,
push for an ambitious EU-India trade deal
and support India’s bid for permanent representation on the UN Security Council
strengthen our economic links with China, doubling support for British firms selling goods there
and championing an EU-China trade deal.
UK exports to China have more than doubled since 2009
We will stand up for British values
Our long-term security and prosperity depend on a stable international system that upholds our values.
Over the last five years, we have stood up for what we believe in:
intervening to stop a massacre in Libya,
leading the world in tackling sexual violence in conflict,
and helping women and children who have fled violence in Syria.
We will continue this leadership.
We will stand up for the freedom of people of all religions – and non-religious people – to practise their beliefs in peace and safety,
for example by supporting persecuted Christians in the Middle East.
We will strengthen the Commonwealth’s focus on promoting democratic values and development.
We will drive forward the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative.
We will support global processes on arms control.
And we will continue to support universal human rights.
We will: uphold our Special Relationship with the USA
and further strengthen our ties with our close Commonwealth allies, Australia, Canada and New Zealand
uphold the democratic rights of the people of Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands to remain British, for as long as that is their wish,
and protect our Overseas Territories
stand up for the rule of law and human rights in Zimbabwe
support a democratic transition in Burma
promote reconciliation and human rights in Sri Lanka,
including through supporting the UN investigation into war crimes, which the Prime Minister was instrumental in securing following his historic visit to Jaffna
actively support Cypriots to find a peaceful and lasting settlement to reunite their island.
Keeping Britain safe
Our plan of action:
We will protect our nation
We will continue to keep our Armed Forces strong so they can continue to keep you safe.
We will maintain the size of the regular armed services and not reduce the army to below 82,000.
We will retain the Trident continuous at sea nuclear deterrent to provide the ultimate guarantee of our safety and
build the new fleet of four Successor Ballistic Missile Submarines
– securing thousands of highly-skilled engineering jobs in the UK.
We will work closely with our allies to continue to strengthen NATO
– supporting its new multi-national rapid response force.
We will maintain our global presence, strengthening our defence partnerships in the Gulf and Asia.
Later this year, we will hold a National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review to plan for the future.
We will maintain a balanced defence budget and give our Armed Forces the equipment they need
We can only have strong, well-funded Armed Forces by continuing to build a stronger economy.
We have the second largest defence budget in NATO
and the largest in the EU.
We are meeting NATO’s two targets: that each country should spend two per cent of its gross national income on defence,
and of that spending 20 per cent should go on major equipment.
We have made commitments for the equipment plan to be funded at one per cent above inflation for the next Parliament.
We plan to invest at least £160 billion in new military equipment over the next decade:
as well as our six new Type 45 destroyers,
we are building a class of seven Astute submarines
and buying the Joint Strike Fighter,
Scout armoured vehicles,
Type 26 frigates
and new Apache attack helicopters.
We will bring both of our new Aircraft Carriers – HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, the largest vessels the Royal Navy has ever possessed – into service, so we have one available for use at all times.
We will continue to seek value for money in defence procurement,
recognising the important contribution that the UK defence industry makes to our prosperity.
We have the biggest defence budget in the EU – and the second biggest in NATO
We will maintain strong, modern Armed Forces
Modern, flexible Armed Forces need strong reserve capacity, alongside strong regular forces.
We have invested significantly in our reserves, and we will deliver on our commitment to expand them to 35,000.
We will continue to invest in our cyber defence capabilities.
We will also provide more opportunities for talented people from all communities and walks of life to serve their country.
We will ensure our Armed Forces overseas are not subject to persistent human rights claims that undermine their ability to do their job.
We will do all we can to honour those who give so much
We will continue to honour the Armed Forces Covenant
We have honoured our commitment to enshrine the Armed Forces Covenant in law and done much to support our servicemen and women.
We have delivered better accommodation for service families,
helped service personnel buy their own home,
and ensured that children of members of the Armed Forces benefit from the Pupil Premium.
We have delivered proper mental health support and priority access to medical treatments for veterans.
To ensure that those who serve can enjoy greater economic security, we have boosted allowances and tax reliefs.
We have protected pensions for our servicemen and women.
We have ensured that injured service personnel have access to the latest prosthetics and world-class rehabilitation facilities.
And we have used £450 million of LIBOR fines from banks to support the Armed Forces community.
The money has been used to support a wide range of charities and good causes, from providing better play facilities for the children of service families, to helping rehabilitation through sport for injured veterans.
We pressed for the introduction of the Arctic Star medal – for veterans of the Arctic Convoys – and the Bomber Command Clasp, to ensure proper recognition for those who risked their lives to keep us free.
We will build on this proud record, implementing Lord Ashcroft’s recommendations on the way the nation fulfils its obligations to veterans.
We will work to address hearing loss among veterans.
And we will continue to support the unsung heroes of the Armed Forces community: the partners and families of those who serve.
Tackling global challenges to make you safer and more prosperous
Our plan of action:
By 2020, we will save 1.4 million children's lives
We will continue to honour our commitments
Tackling global poverty is both the right thing to do and in Britain’s interests.
We have delivered on our promises to meet the UN target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income as aid and to enshrine this in law.
We will continue to meet the 0.7 per cent target,
maintain an independent Department for International Development
and keep aid untied.
Our aid budget meets the OECD aid rules,
and we will actively engage in international discussions to ensure that these rules fully reflect the importance of peace, stability,
and effective institutions for reducing poverty.
We will insist that every government and organisation we fund meets global transparency standards.
We will save lives
By 2020, we will save 1.4 million children’s lives, by immunising 76 million children against killer diseases.
We will help at least 11 million children in the poorest countries gain a decent education,
improve nutrition for at least 50 million people, who would otherwise go hungry;
and help at least 60 million people get access to clean water and sanitation, to stop terrible diseases.
We will continue to lead the response to humanitarian emergencies, and establish a means to respond rapidly to crises.
Our leading role in dealing with the recent outbreak of Ebola in West Africa is a good example of how our aid programme helps protect Britain from serious threats,
while also helping countries tackle major emergencies which put their stability at risk.
We will lead a major new global programme to accelerate the development of vaccines and drugs to eliminate the world’s deadliest infectious diseases,
while investing to save lives from malaria
and working to end preventable child and maternal deaths.
We will expand payment by results and ensure all money to governments is clearly earmarked for specific purposes.
We will tackle the causes of poverty and promote gender equality
We will push for new global goals to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030
and promote human development,
gender equality
and good governance.
We will work to prevent climate change and assist the poorest in adapting to it.
As the route out of poverty is about much more than just aid,
we will boost growth and jobs,
making it easier for people to start up businesses
and trade freely with each other.
We will continue to promote the golden thread of democracy, the rule of law, property rights, a free media and open, accountable institutions.
We will promote girls’ education,
encourage equal access to property rights
and work to achieve access to family planning for everyone who wants it.
We will continue to lead efforts to tackle violence against women and girls, end FGM
and combat early and forced marriage, both at home and abroad.
We will help you fight poverty
Our International Citizen Service has given thousands of young Brits the opportunity to volunteer abroad.
We will triple it in size.
We will also double our successful Aid Match scheme, which matches donations to charity from the aid budget.
We will boost partnerships between UK institutions and their counterparts in the developing world,
and help people in the UK give or lend money directly to individuals and entrepreneurs around the world.
Conclusion SO THIS IS OUR DETAILED PLAN FOR BRITAIN. Our plan to entrench the progress of the past five years. Our plan for you and your family, at every stage of your life. IT IS UNDERPINNED BY SOME SIMPLE CONSERVATIVE VALUES. Those who work hard and do the right thing must be rewarded. Everyone should be able to rise as high as their talents and effort will take them. We measure our success not just in how we show our strength abroad, but in how we care for the weakest and most vulnerable at home. ABOVE ALL, RUNNING THROUGH THIS PLAN  IS A TRUE BELIEF IN BRITAIN. In the past five years, as so often before in our history, we have once again defied the expectations of the world to rise up and meet our challenges. The British character is renewed every day by the millions who work hard, raise their families, care for those who need help, who do the right thing – and make this country what it is. THIS MANIFESTO IS ABOUT IMPROVING THE LIVES  OF EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE. Together we have come so far. If we stick to our long-term plan, we can secure a better future for you and your family. So let us keep moving forward; and set our sights on making our great country greater still.
