Like all good things, immigration should be practiced with a degree of moderation.
The Ulster Unionist Party welcomes immigrants who have something to offer our society;
who wish to assimilate and absorb our values of tolerance, hard work and civic responsibility;
who add value to who we are.
We also recognise we operate with finite resources and will seek the power to stop those who see our way of life as nothing more than a meal ticket, or a means to access already stretched public services.
We seek an immigration policy that is open, transparent and fair.
We will: Have a zero tolerance policy on illegal immigration,
while being responsive to genuine asylum seekers;
Place the EU free movement rules at the heart of renegotiations to ensure that our hands aren’t tied to tackle illegal immigration;
Seek to withdraw from agreements where decisions are better made at the member state rather than at the European Level;
Have a zero tolerance approach to racist attacks;
Remove any unfair impediment in the way of immigrants and their families who wish to help Northern Ireland grow into the most successful region in Western Europe;
Seek a memorial to those Polish service personnel who served in the Royal Air Force and paid the ultimate sacrifice during the Second World War and were based here in Northern Ireland;
Support the exclusion of the NHS from the scope of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) currently being negotiated between the European Union and the United States of America.
OUR ETHNIC MINORITIES
The Ulster Unionist Party is moving away from the old binary approach to life in Northern Ireland, where each individual is labelled as Orange or Green.
We embrace the richness of our new, diverse society, as evidenced by multi-coloured and multi-cultural events like the annual Mela celebration in Belfast, which packs 25,000 people into the Botanic Gardens in a single day, to experience cultural diversity in song, dance and food.
For some, it is an inconvenient truth that without immigrants, parts of our private and public sectors would struggle to operate.
We have successful businesses that thrive only because members of our ethnic minorities are prepared to do jobs that others would rather avoid.
Our Health Service relies heavily on highly skilled immigrants, without them it would almost certainly collapse.
Some highly intensive manual jobs, not least in the agri-food sector are also deeply dependent on workers from our ethnic groups.
We will: Support a Racial Equality Strategy for Northern Ireland;
Focus on the inclusion and integration of young people from minority backgrounds;
Open all public spaces to becoming welcoming of people from ethnic minority backgrounds;
Monitor funding of minority ethnic and religious groups to ensure government support is fair, transparent and proportionate;
Commit to ensuring people from minority ethnic backgrounds feel safe;
Support people from minority ethnic backgrounds who fully contribute to our society, through education, the economy, health services, community activities, sports and the arts.
LOOKING OUT FOR ALL IN SOCIETY
KEEPING COMMUNITIES SAFE
Throughout its existence the Ulster Unionist Party has been the Party of law and order.
The fundamental right of people to feel safe in their own home is as valid now as ever before.
Unfortunately, not only is crime still prevalent in many areas, but so too is the fear of crime.
We must help the PSNI address this.
For decades, our police force tackled terrorist groupings from within our society.
Now the focus has broadened to international organised crime gangs.
The eventual roll out of the National Crime Agency will assist their efforts, but Northern Ireland’s politicians collectively must adopt a zero tolerance approach to organised crime.
We will: Campaign to include Kincora in the terms of reference for the national inquiry into historical child abuse;
Ensure the focus remains on police officers carrying out frontline services rather than administration;
Monitor the PSNI's efforts in tackling the threats posed by serious crime;
Prioritise the tackling of crime against our older people;
Set up a taskforce to tackle fuel laundering in border areas;
End unnecessary delays in the criminal justice system.
STANDING UP FOR RIGHTS OF VICTIMS
Thirty years of terrorism devastated Northern Ireland and left a legacy that will be acutely felt for many years to come.
Outrages such as the On The Runs scandal serve to inflict further pain and trauma on those who suffered the most.
We will: Introduce legislation at Parliament to ensure that the OTR letters have no legal effect and which also enable prosecutions to take place, where possible;
Take measures to end the trauma suffered by victims and survivors who do not know whether the person who hurt them or their loved one is in receipt of an On The Run letter;
Provide victims and survivors groups with the resources they need to operate effectively;
Continue to campaign to end the equivalence of perpetrators and genuine victims;
Continue to ensure the former Maze Prison site does not become a shrine to terrorist violence;
Continue to work with the new UK Government to secure settlements from foreign countries that assisted terrorist groupings.
SUPPORTING YOUNGER AND OLDER PEOPLE
No matter a person’s age they all deserve to be supported adequately by their Government.
Old age should be a joy, not a journey of fear, uncertainty and abandonment.
Growing up should be full of the excitement of the voyage of discovery.
Our younger people and our elderly face particular challenges and the Ulster Unionist Party is determined to support you.
Of particular concern to us is the unnecessary and extremely unsympathetic treatment by some health trusts of elderly citizens in care homes.
To reduce octogenarians to tears because they have been told to find a new place to live is simply unacceptable in our vision of Northern Ireland.
We will: Ensure adequate provision of domiciliary care to allow older people to remain in their own homes;
Protect universal benefits such as the winter fuel payment,
concessionary fares
and the TV licence for the elderly;
Introduce adult safeguarding legislation that specifically tackles abuse of the elderly;
Support lowering the voting age to 16;
Expand internet safety measures to protect children in Northern Ireland;
Retain the Educational Maintenance Allowance to allow young people to remain in education.
ASSISTING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
In the 21st Century everyone deserves to be treated equally.
That includes those who face the challenges of a learning or physical disability.
The Ulster Unionist Party is committed to removing economic, social and cultural barriers for people with a disability.
We will: Ensure that young people with a disability have a statutory right to learn in all appropriate educational settings;
Introduce legislation that provides a legal right to independent living;
Require public sector bodies to offer and facilitate work placements for people with a disability;
Guarantee the appropriate construction and provision of housing for people with additional need.
RESPECTING ALL CULTURES, FAITHS AND SEXUALITIES
Northern Ireland’s unique mix of fascinating heritage and its rich culture makes it a fascinating place to live and work.
The Ulster Unionist Party is committed to building a society that welcomes diversity.
We will: Safeguard the rights of those who wish to express their culture.
That includes respecting the rights of bands and the Loyal Orders;
Ensure young people leave education with a better understanding of sexual and cultural diversity through age-appropriate teaching.
MEETING THE NEEDS OF RURAL COMMUNITIES
Many people in Northern Ireland are fortunate enough to live in our rural areas.
However, it does present particular challenges.
We will: Ensure appropriate access to health, education and public transport services;
Place a statutory obligation to ‘rural proof’ changes to services in rural areas;
Deliver a planning system that allows rural communities to become more sustainable with new housing;
Promote the diversification of agricultural and other land-based rural businesses to grow the rural economy;
Support sustainable rural tourism.
TACKLING DISADVANTAGE
Despite all our economic advances and innovations, the proportion of households who fall below society’s minimum standard of living has increased greatly over recent decades.
Entire communities are now blighted with poverty.
In addition, our experience of violence in the past has also greatly increased deprivation and disadvantage in the present.
We will: Ensure work pays in order to break the cycle of welfare dependency;
Introduce a statutory duty on Departments to work towards eliminating child poverty;
Close the 23% prosperity gap that has developed between citizens here and the rest of the UK.
