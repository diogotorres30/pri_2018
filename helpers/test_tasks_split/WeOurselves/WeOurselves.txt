uniting thE Community -rights, Equality anD rEspECt an pobal a aontú -CEarta, Cothromas agus mEas
Sinn Féin believes in a rights-based society underpinned by social and economic justice, where everyone is treated equally and given equal access to opportunities.
Rights, equality and respect are the way to build a united community.
There can be no justification for discrimination under the guise of a conscience clause,
no acceptance of sectarianism under the guise of tradition
and no resort to racism under the guise of tabloid popularism.
Sinn Féin is seeking to build a pluralist, inclusive and equal society.
Sinn Féin will prioritise:
The implementation of an Acht Gaelige as agreed to promote the Irish language and safeguards the rights of Irish speakers.
A Bill of Rights for all Citizens
and an All-Ireland charter of fundamental rights.
The resolution of parades disputes in line with that agreed in the Stormont House Agreement.
Ending segregation through the removal of peace walls building on experience and dialogue between local communities.
Campaigning against all forms of racism
and for an inclusive and welcoming society which embraces all our citizens equally.
Campaign to reduce the gender pay gap.
Support quotas and legislation to increase the participate of women in political and public life.
Campaigning to ensure everyone has access to legal redress if they are discriminated against.
Campaigning against all age discrimination in accessing goods, facilities and services.
Ensuring the law treats all children equally regardless of family status or the sexual orientation or gender identity of their parents.
Campaigning to ensure that those aged 16 and over are entitled to vote.
Developing legislation to address online bullying and harassment in all forms including sectarianism, transphobia, homophobia and racism.
Opposing the Conscience Clause, recognising it for what it is, an attempt to erode human rights and reduce the effectiveness of equality legislation.
Championing the cause of transgender people to ensure that they have equal access to goods, facilities and services.
Supporting the right of the lesbian, gay and bisexual people to marriage equality.
Including equality protections for LGBT citizens and prohibitions on homophobic and transphobic discrimination in the forthcoming Bill of Rights for the north.
Pushing for legislation north and south for equal treatment of prospective LGBT parents in reproductive and adoptive services, and in related social and other public services.
truth rECovEry an FhírinnE
During the negotiations which led to the Stormont House Agreement Sinn Féin resisted attempts by the British Government and other parties to have current and future inquests removed from Coroners’ Courts and placed within the remit of the Historical Investigations Unit.
Once again the British government and its allies within unionism sought to thwart the efforts of embattled families seeking the truth about the circumstances of their loved ones’ deaths.
For Sinn Féin this was a red-line issue we would not cross.
That resistance has ensured that families will have Article 2 compliant inquests and we will continue to give full support to them as they seek to achieve maximum disclosure from a reluctant British government.
The creation of the Historical Investigation Unit (HIU) provides families with the opportunity to learn more about the truth surrounding the death of their loved ones.
The Stormont House Agreement commits the British government to making full disclosure to the HIU and we will be seeking to ensure that they do not resile from their commitment to supply all of the relevant information to the families.
We continue to press the British government to hold a full independent public inquiry into the murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane.
This was a commitment given at Weston Park.
During the negotiations in December the Irish government, despite its alleged support for such an inquiry, failed miserably to address this issue and hold the British government to account.
The families of the Dublin/Monaghan bombings and the Ballymurphy massacre are still waiting on information in files held by the British government so as they can learn the full truth regarding the death of their loved ones.
In the Stormont House Agreement both governments recognised that there were outstanding investigations and allegations into conflict-related incidents, including a number of cross-border incidents and committed to cooperation with all bodies involved to enable their effective operation.
We will be working to ensure that the British government provides all information to the Barron Inquiry.
We will be working to ensure that the British government provides all information to the families of Pat Finucane,
of the victims of the Dublin/Monaghan bombings
and of the Ballymurphy massacre.

Sinn Féin have honoured all agreements that we have entered into.
Making and implementing agreements is the foundation stone of the political process.
There are key elements of the Good Friday Agreement that have still not been implemented, including a Bill of Rights
and the establishment of a Civic Forum.
In addition at Weston Park the British government agreed to establish a full inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.
At St Andrew’s in 2006 there was a commitment made by the British government to legislate for the Irish language through an Acht Gaeilge.
They reneged on those commitments too.
Since the Stormont House Agreement was reached on the cusp of Christmas Eve Sinn Féin has engaged positively with the Party Leaders’ group to ensure its full implementation.
This includes the provision agreed to protect welfare benefits
Sinn Féin continues to demand the implementation of all outstanding agreements
and will continue to work constructively to drive forward the peace process.
Sinn Féin will:
Continue to work for full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.
Push for a Bill of Rights
and work towards an all-Island Charter of Rights.
Push for the re-establishment of the Civic Forum
and north-south consultative forum.
Push for the review and improvement of north south bodies.
Deliver Acht na Gaeilge.
Deliver a referendum on Irish unity.
Deliver the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.
