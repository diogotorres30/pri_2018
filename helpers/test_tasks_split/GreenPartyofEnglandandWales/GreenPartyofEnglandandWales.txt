In the long run we have to create a transport system that is socially just and addresses health inequality by prioritising affordable access to services by walking, cycling and public transport,
by reducing road danger,
by cleaning up our air
and by minimising congestion.
This transport system should use electricity, not oil,
and make our towns, cities and villages into more liveable, socially inclusive places.
Against this backdrop, mainstream transport policy, which urges us to travel further and faster than ever before, is senseless, yet this is what all parties except the Green Party offer you.
The key to getting this right is to manage demand rather than increase it; that is, to reduce the need to travel in the first place.
We need to: Reduce the distances travelled,
reduce the number of journeys made by car
and switch as many journeys as possible to walking, cycling and public transport;
Encourage alternatives to travel, such as video-conferencing;
Integrate different transport options and provide seamless door–to-door journeys;
Prioritise everyday access for everybody wherever they live to local facilities such as the shops, the doctors’ surgery, schools and workplaces;
and Enable more people to get to where they need to go while using a car less.
Green Party transport policy prioritises in this order, building from the bottom up:
walking and disabled access to all other forms of transport;
cycling;
public transport (trains, light rail/trams, buses and ferries)
and rail- and water-borne freight;
light goods vehicles, taxis and low-powered motor cycles;
private motorised transport (cars and high-powered motor cycles);
heavy goods vehicles;
and aircraft.
Green councillors mean safer streets...
Green councillors were instrumental in bringing in 20 mph limits on many residential roads in Norwich, Islington and Leicester, as well as a default 20 mph limit on all residential roads in Lancashire and in Brighton & Hove.
Bringing the railways into public hands
For trains to play their part in the total journey experience, they need to connect seamlessly with buses and convenient walking and cycling routes to local centres of habitation.
The Green Party is committed to bringing rail services into public ownership and control.
The current fragmented structure does not put the passenger and the total journey experience at the centre of planning and has created a costly, wasteful, uncoordinated outcome.
Recent experience in running the East Coast Main Line within the public sector has shown that both quality and receipts to the Treasury go up when a rail service is run in this way,
whereas experience on the West Coast Main Line in the private sector shows that the franchise system is costly, wasteful and not fit for purpose.
The Green Party will consult widely on the organisational details of a rail operation in public ownership and how it will link to democratic accountability at the regional and city-region geographical scales.
Diesel exhaust emissions are a known human carcinogen
and diesel trains do not perform as well as electrified rail operations in terms of passenger comfort, acceleration and deceleration, and the ability to make more stops at intermediate stations with minimal impact on overall journey time.
The Green Party wants to see electrification of the railway system to achieve levels to be found in Germany (59% of track electrified) or Sweden (73% electrified).
The UK has 34% of its track electrified.
High levels of electrification reduce health-damaging air pollution,
reduce greenhouse gases
and deliver a much-improved passenger experience.
Electrification will also require new rolling stock and the Green Party will promote the design and manufacturing of this new stock in the UK,
contributing to job creation in those regions with higher than average unemployment.
Putting this plan into action for the common good means bringing the railways back into public ownership – making them belong to you and me, run by rail workers for passengers.
On 26 June 2013, Green MP Caroline Lucas published a Private Members’ Bill to do just this, a policy supported by 66% of the British public.
The privatised railways cost over £1 billion a year in: Interest payments; Debt write-offs; The costs of railway fragmentation; The profit margins of tiers of contractors and sub-contractors;  Payments to shareholders; and Bonuses paid to railway bosses (up to 166% of annual salaries).
Between 1997 and 2013, rail fares leapt by 22%, while road users have experienced a 9% drop – exactly the wrong priority.
Rail isn’t really ‘private’ anyway – 60% of the network is owned by state-backed foreign companies.
And this ‘private’ system takes £4 billion in public subsidies every year.
Labour’s response is to require the state to bid for franchises it already owns – at millions of pounds a time.
As Caroline says, a privatised railway ‘is a blatant transfer of public money to private interests at the expense of the taxpayer and rail passengers’.
Bringing the railways back into public ownership would cost very little if it was done as existing franchises fell due for renewal.
This will: Save money;
Mean a better deal for passengers;
Allow local authorities to plan and run local services;
Increase the scope for the democratic involvement of local communities in planning and running railways;
and Reduce congestion and improve safety.
In addition on the railways, we would not support HS2 (the proposed high-speed network).
The money to be spent on this hugely expensive project, which at best will reduce journey times for a few passengers, would be much better spent on improving the conventional rail connections between various major cities,
improving the resilience of the existing network to climate change
and reopening lines and stations that have been closed.
Decarbonising transport
The major challenge for our transport system is to decarbonise it and end its reliance on fossil fuels.
We would: End the wasteful and destructive national major roads programme, saving £15 billion over the Parliament.
Spend part of this £15 billion on improving and subsidising public transport, with an average fare reduction of 10% costing £8 billion over the Parliament,
fixing potholes in existing roads
and investing in walking and cycling.
Support walking and cycling.
In particular, we would ensure that pedestrians and cyclists get their fare share of road space and would spend at least £30 per head on them over every year of the Parliament.
Funding should be allocated flexibly to make safe, convenient routes that address the needs of pedestrians and cyclists while reducing any risk of conflict between them.
Support the re-regulation of bus services to provide a better, more reliable service.
End the favourable tax treatment of aviation
and have a separate target for aviation emissions of below 37.5 million tonnes CO2 equivalent a year.
Stop airport expansion, in particular no new runways at either Heathrow or Gatwick,
and ban night flying.
Invest in electric vehicle charging points for buses and taxis, and for cars where there are gaps in the network of public and community transport.
Incentivise consolidation of white van deliveries so that last-mile deliveries can be made by cargo bikes and electric vehicles in local areas.
Affordable public transport
Instead of prestige projects such HS2 and new runways, we need to prioritise local transport and make sure it is accessible to everybody.
The Green Party would: Prioritise affordable local public transport,
accessible to all, including those with disabilities.
Support free local transport for pensioners, including the existing local bus pass scheme and the Freedom Pass in London.
Extend free local public transport to young people and students, costing around £4 billion a year.
Develop regional smart payment systems with integrated ticketing, like the London Oyster system.
Extend networks of public transport to include rural areas.
A step change in road safety
The numbers of people killed or seriously injured on the UK’s roads have fallen in recent years.
But they are still appallingly high: 1,713 people died on the roads in 2013, and 21,657 were seriously injured, far worse than for other modes of transport.
We will: Work for a road transport system that results in zero deaths or serious injuries by systematically reducing sources of danger on the roads.
Reduce both collisions and fuel use by bringing down speed limits, in particular to 20 mph in residential areas, including main roads where people live, work and shop;
enforce speed limits with speed cameras and policing.
Change the culture of road justice and civil compensation with a road danger reduction approach.
A greater duty of care should be expected of drivers in reducing injury and intimidation of vulnerable road users.
Motor vehicle drivers should be presumed liable for injuries to pedestrians and cyclists.
If the casualty has contributed to the collision, compensation may be reduced, but not when the victim is a child, elderly (70+) or impaired.
Reduce the alcohol limit for drivers to as close to zero as is practicable.
Require newly manufactured lorries to be equipped with best practice technology to make sure that drivers are fully aware of the presence of all pedestrians and cyclists.
Pedestrian and cyclist fatalities and serious injuries when involved in collisions with lorries are predictable, preventable and unacceptable.
The technology already exists and is in use in several countries and consists of a mixture of in-cab screens linked to cameras, multiple wing mirrors and physical modification to prevent people being dragged under the vehicle.
Lorries already in use must be retro-fitted with the same equipment and lorries not so equipped will not be allowed into our towns and cities.
Reduce lorry activity and road freight volume by improving rail freight services,
reducing the number of empty or partially loaded trips,
and using cargo bikes for last-mile deliveries to replace some white van trips.
Towns and cities for people We need to rescue our towns and cities from traffic and turn them back into places where we want to be.
The Green Party will support an Active Travel Bill for England in order to achieve this.
Make streets healthy and safe places for people to cycle and walk and for children to play,
while building physical activity into their daily journeys.
Help schools and workplaces to support active travel to and from work, and encourage local authorities to assist this by linking their public health and transport functions.
Ensure that all planning decisions have to take into account the active travel and public transport implications.
Make public transport more convenient by integrating ticketing with smart regional ticketing systems such as the LondonOyster card.
Introduce road-pricing schemes such as the London congestion charge and road-user tolls for heavy lorries.
Begin consultation with a view to developing a framework for the progressive elimination of diesel exhaust emissions.
A major cause of air pollution is emissions from diesel vehicles (cars, buses and trains).
We recognise the latest scientific evidence of the harmful effect of diesel on human health.
Introduce Ultra Low Emission Zones to ensure air pollution reduces to comply with EU limits.
Reduce the need for car parking spaces by reducing car dependency and transferring trips, where appropriate, to walking, cycling and public transport.
Car parking is expensive to provide, can obstruct pedestrians and people with disabilities if it takes place on pavements, and takes up valuable road space that could be reallocated to pedestrians and cyclists.
Reduce parking spaces in new developments and increase rates of walking, cycling and public transport by strengthening planning law to make best practice travel plans mandatory for workplaces, homes and other destinations.
Eliminate pavement parking and, in close cooperation with waste collection and emergency services, make sure that these essential services have unimpeded access to all addresses.
Ensure that parking policies in residential areas deliver a high-quality street environment and reduce the numbers of those who are clogging up residential streets as part of a commuter trip or other activities not related to a visit to an address in that street.
Parking charges of all kinds in public car parks and streets will be proportionate to the full cost of providing that facility.
Provide cycle parking throughout towns and cities at locations where there is demand
and invest in on-street secure cycle storage in residential streets.
A rural transport revolution
Approximately 20% of the UK population live in rural areas and many of these are retired and may have to adjust to a lifestyle without a car for health and income reasons.
It is essential that rural areas get the best possible deal for widening transport choices.
The Green Party does not accept that there is a fundamental and intractable rural transport problem.
Rural transport in many parts of Germany, Austria and Switzerland is of a very high quality and the quality is based on careful planning, coordination and investment and recognition that, although a car will be needed for a proportion of journeys, it is not the default option.
The small village of Gempen in Switzerland, with a population of about 800, has ten buses each day that connect with tram and train services at the next-larger settlement (Dornach).
We will: Make sure that rural areas are not neglected when transport budgets and planning for our cities and city regions are under discussion.
Develop networks of community and public transport to provide regular links to onward transport networks.
Introduce speed limits of 20 mph in villages and 40 mph on rural roads.
Green councillors bring safer cycling...
Lancaster Greens helped to deliver the Cycling Demonstration Town project with more than £4 million external funding for safer routes and cycling promotion.
Greens in power carry out our transport policies
In Green-led Brighton, the Council has: Introduced the largest connected 20 mph zone in the country, and casualties fell by 19%;
Built a new cycle hub at the station;
Introduced cycle priority at junctions, proper cycle lanes and cycle contraflow lanes;
Introduced the first ‘floating’ bus stop, resulting in: bus usage increasing by almost 9% over two years,
falling nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions,
an 11% increase in daily cycle journeys between 2009 and 2012,
and falling road casualties, with 200 fewer killed and injured in 2013 than in 2011.
CHAPTER 13
Imagine the UK as a good global neighbour,
committed to peacemaking
and to helping create the conditions for a flourishing life for everyone on the planet.
This is a UK bent on resolving conflicts rather than making them worse, determined to listen as well as to speak.
How about the chance to vote for a Europe of self reliance rather than free trade and indiscriminate growth?
Imagine a climate change agreement that is both just and effective.
Picture a world where the big decisions are made by democratically elected governments and not by private corporations – picture the end of talk of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)...
We live in an interconnected world, which brings huge benefits as well as drawbacks.
Decisions that we make affect people in other countries, and events in other countries affect us.
In particular, UK foreign and military policies over many years have contributed to challenges to our security today:
By using up global resources or polluting the air or water that we all share;
By influencing how much we pay for diminishing natural resources
and how much we get paid for our labour;
By driving displacement;
By creating insecurity at home and abroad.
Greens are internationalists and want to live in a world that is just and fair, secure and peaceful, and where human rights are universally respected.
We will make the UK a force for international good,
respected throughout the global community,
with coherent foreign policies based on building effective and cooperative security relations across the world.
All countries deserve a voice in global decision-making, and we want to use ours to support the following:
A new, holistic and consistent approach to peace and defence, which is focused on genuine peacekeeping and respect for the sovereignty of peoples around the world.
A fundamental restructuring of our global economy, with power held at the local and regional level and only passed upwards when international cooperation is necessary.
We call this ‘subsidiarity’ – this principle is the basis of our approach to the European Union and other international organisations.
Writing off and writing down unpayable international debt,
avoiding paternalistic aid,
and securing the rights of First Nations peoples.
Trade that supports the well-being of workers that can be achieved without breaching sustainability limits is useful, but a blind commitment to ‘free’ trade is not.
A global policy of Contraction and Convergence in which rich countries’ use of finite energy resources contracts, while that of poorer countries expands, to converge on an equitable and sustainable per capita sharing of global energy,
designed to keep within 2 degrees C of warming.
Only in this way can poor countries improve living standards while the world as a whole avoids hitting resource and climate limits.
Making UK foreign policy genuinely independent, based on the principles of shared responsibility, cooperative security
and human rights.
We will: Work to reform the United Nations and associated bodies, to reflect better the needs and interests of all countries,
and make the UN more representative and effective through abolishing permanent seats on the UN Security Council (UNSC).
Seek negotiated settlements to a range of conflicts around the world
and block sales of weapons and military equipment that increase misery and death for non-combatants and have particularly destructive impacts on vulnerable peoples, notably women and children.
Outlaw the use of torture,
the sale of torture equipment
and the rendition of people to countries where torture is not prohibited,
and enforce the laws against it.
Take proportionate measures to protect against terrorism,
ensuring that civil liberties are not undermined in the process
, that communities are not scapegoated
and that action reflects a genuine assessment of the threat to our security.
We need targeted policing and security service activities, not mass surveillance,
prisons that rehabilitate those convicted of terrorism offences and effective programmes to prevent radicalisation and to deradicalise individuals.
Uphold the principles of freedom of speech and peaceful protest,
including support for vulnerable communities of all religious faiths and none.
In relation to specific international challenges around election time: We opposed military interventions in Afghanistan, Libya and Iraq,
and will oppose all future interventions that lack a sufficient moral, legal and democratic mandate
or when military action risks being counter-productive, for example by providing fertile recruitment, fundraising and propaganda opportunities.
We will instead advocate for regional solutions to conflicts and for the UK to take a lead in advancing diplomatic, economic and political solutions to the threats posed by terrorist groups such as ISIS and Boko Haram.
We would provide humanitarian support for the millions of refugees displaced by these conflicts.
We seek a just, sustainable and peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, based on mutual recognition of the rights to independent statehood for Palestinians and Israelis.
We condemn human rights violations by both parties
and the oppression and disproportionate use of aggression by the Israeli government against the people of Gaza.
We seek to suspend the EU– Israel Association Agreement.
`We condemn state-sanctioned breaches of human rights by countries such as China, Syria, Sudan and Pakistan, as well as by individuals or organisations,
`and we advocate the use of sanctions and legal action via the International Criminal Court for those violating international human rights standards.
We would work to support a negotiated settlement between Russia and Ukraine,
while developing a new security structure for the region involving the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, with opposition to arms transfers and military interventions in regional and internal conflicts.
International agreement on climate change
A global climate disaster can be prevented only if the whole world works together.
The Green Party will make it its main foreign policy priority to secure a major new international agreement,
in particular at the UN meeting in Paris in December 2015, with a wide-ranging workable plan to arrest climate change
and share global resources more evenly.
The basis of this agreement should be Contraction and Convergence (C&C).
C&C means: Allowing countries that currently emit very little carbon dioxide to increase their emissions,
using their energy resources to reduce poverty and improve their people’s well-being.
Requiring all other countries to reduce their emissions to a small per capita limit, fixed to be consistent with a global limit that keeps temperature rises below 2 degrees C.
Recognising the special responsibility of countries such as the UK that have become wealthy from 200 years of fossil-fuelbased industrialisation.
Some of this wealth will need to be shared with poorer countries that have left their fossil fuels in the ground and their forests still standing.
In these ways, by an agreed date, every citizen of the world will have a fair and equal share of global emissions potential.
Being rich will no longer permit people to unfairly affect the whole world’s atmosphere and climate.
Security and defence
The UK’s recent history has been scarred by involvement in ill-advised military interventions that have undermined our national and international security.
The Green Party opposed these interventions, which have brought havoc to Iraq and Libya and only fragile gains in Afghanistan,
as well as driving an increased terrorist threat closer to home – all at the cost of many precious lives and vast amounts of money and other resources that could have been better used for other needs.
Green MP Caroline Lucas challenged the PM in the debate on 26 September 2014 on military action in Iraq ‘Will the Prime Minister recognise that killing extremists does not kill their ideas?
On the contrary – it can often feed their ideas, and for that reason the former MI6 head of counter-terrorism has said that getting Saudi Arabia and Iran around a negotiating table would be far more effective than bombing.
Why are we not hearing far more from this Prime Minister about the political and diplomatic solutions to this situation, rather than reaching for the military solution, which could undermine them?’
We will restructure and update the UK’s security and defence establishments and services so that they contribute to the international good.
We will: Pursue a policy of ‘defensive defence’, which threatens no one yet makes it clear that threats and attacks will be resisted.
Take a leading role in preventing violent conflict, genocide and war crimes overseas through (i) helping to develop local capacities to avoid, manage and resolve conflicts;
and (ii) enhancing the UK’s well-respected role in genuine peacekeeping and the protection of non-combatant communities.
Develop policies and programmes for ‘environmental defence’ and disaster mitigation and relief, drawing on the skills and activities of our current military forces
and increasing gender representation and training to equip the UK to contribute more effectively in these kinds of human security emergencies.
Diminish dependence on arms sales through a halt to government subsidies
and introducing a strict licensing regime to prevent sales of weapons and military equipment to undemocratic regimes and those that violate human rights (including, at the present time, Israel and Saudi Arabia).
Look after veterans and their families.
International disarmament and security agreements
The Green Party will ensure that UK security and defence policies are consistent with international law, including international humanitarian law,
and that the UK implements in good faith all relevant obligations in the following international treaties: the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Outer Space Treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the Mine Ban Treaty, the Cluster Munitions Convention, the Arms Trade Treaty, the UN Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons, and the Geneva Protocols.
We will: Enhance UK cooperation with civil society and international agencies to implement relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, including UNSC Resolutions 1325, 1820 and 1889, dealing with the role of gender violence in war
and the necessity to involve women at all levels in preventing war and building peace and security.
Save a massive £100 billion over the next 30 years by cancelling Trident replacement and decommissioning existing nuclear forces and facilities.
Enhance international security and non-proliferation by initiating and/or joining negotiations on a universally applicable nuclear abolition treaty to prohibit the use, deployment, development, production, stockpiling and transfer of nuclear weapons and requiring their complete elimination.
Initiate and/or join negotiations on new international treaties and laws to prohibit the development, deployment and use of autonomous weapons (such as ‘killer robots’),
depleted uranium weapons,
weapon systems that are intended for use in and from outer space,
and weapons that leave explosive remnants and toxic legacies in war-affected communities,
while mandating the protection of civilians from any new weapons developments for the future.
Green MEP Keith Taylor and Palestine Keith Taylor is a member of the European Parliament’s delegation to Palestine and has visited the Occupied Territories.
As part of his work, Keith has called for Israel to end its practice of detaining Palestinians without charge, and has supported his constituents in boycott campaigns relating to goods made in illegal Israeli settlements.
Keith has long campaigned for the recognition of Palestine and has put his name to a successful Resolution calling on the European Parliament to recognise Palestine as a state.
Joining up the policies So what do war, terrorism, food policy and the oil industry have to do with each other?
If we didn’t depend on oil from the Middle East, we wouldn’t need to invent reasons to go to war there when supply lines are threatened.
If we weren’t involved in wars in the Middle East, terrorism here would lose its raison d’être.
With less fossil fuel we would have to expand renewables and grow more of our own food, making us far less vulnerable to blockade in any future war.
Security policy is not just about tanks, it’s also about acting responsibly and building resilience at home.
It’s another virtuous circle..
Europe
The Green Party recognises that the UK is part of Europe and that we cannot cut ourselves off from our geography or its political realities.
Our message on Europe is positive, not based on fear and nostalgia.
Much EU action has been progressive:
safeguarding basic rights,
peace and security achieved through mutual understanding,
environmental protection,
the spread of culture and ideas,
and regulation of the financial system.
And in other areas, such as welfare policy, open discussion and coordination are useful.
However, we prioritise local self-reliance rather than the EU’s unsustainable economics of free trade and growth.
We would not adopt the Euro, which cannot work properly without much deeper political integration, and this would be contrary to our policy of subsidiarity.
We support the proposal to have an in–out referendum so that the British people can have their say.
This is because much has changed since the UK joined the Common Market in 1974.
Endless debate on membership is a diversion from more important matters, such as ending inequality and adapting our economy to One-Planet Living.
So it’s yes to Europe,
yes to reform of the EU
but also yes to a referendum.
This is the policy that led to the election of an additional Green MEP, Molly Scott Cato, in the South West last year.
Migration
Migration is a fact of life.
People have always moved within countries and between countries.
Much of the UK’s language, culture and way of life has been enriched by successive new arrivals over thousands of years.
Most families living here will have members of their extended family who live abroad or include members who were born abroad – 5 million British citizens live abroad, around 2 million of them in the EU.
We take it for granted that we can move to live where we like within our country, and increasingly within Europe and further afield, as others do.
Much of the time, migration is voluntary, is on a relatively small scale and is a positive benefit for all concerned.
But, increasingly, people are being forced to move because Climate change affects their environment so that it can no longer support them;
The economic opportunities in their home country are so limited that they leave home to work abroad;
or War, natural disasters or political repression lead them to become refugees.
These pressures lead to growing numbers of people seeking to come to the UK from the EU and elsewhere.
But it is wrong to scapegoat immigrants for problems with housing, education, health or local authority services.
These problems are the result of successive governments’ policy failure, which the rest of this manifesto is designed to put right.
The Green Party believes that, in the medium to long term, we must reduce the pressures that lead to involuntary migration.
We will Seek through our international policies to reduce war and discourage repressive regimes that lead to the creation of refugees.
Make a global deal on climate change a priority of our foreign policy,
and help poorer countries cope with the climate change.
Seek to promote ecologically sustainable development in the poorer parts of the world,
so that there is greater equality between the richer and poorer nations.
Promote policies in the EU that improve opportunities across the Union
and refocus on social and environmental benefits, rather than economic liberalisation.
We accept that these policies will take time to work and that we must address immigration as it is here and now.
Some controls on immigration will be needed for the foreseeable future; for now, we reject an open borders approach.
We also reject the imposition of an arbitrary numerical cap on net migration.
The latter in particular is impossible to achieve (especially given that there is no control on the numbers emigrating) and leads to many individual injustices.
Any controls must respect the following principles: Mutual legal obligations within the EU on freedom of movement.
International obligations to accept refugees, whether seeking sanctuary from wars, political repression or climate change.
Respect for the integrity of families.
The arrival of a grandmother might well have no direct economic effect, but her contribution to family life may contribute hugely to our society.
We would in particular abolish the policy that requires a British citizen to have an income of at least £18,600 a year before their partner can come to live in the UK, which discriminates against poorer people,
make it much easier for adult dependants, mainly elderly parents, of British citizens to come and live here.
No restrictions on foreign students.
Foreign students contribute hugely to our education system, both financially and in terms of the wider perspectives they bring.
They also take back to their home countries skills that they have learnt here that will be valuable at home and positive attitudes towards the UK.
In particular we would allow students to work in the UK for two years after graduation;
widen the Youth Mobility Scheme to allow those from poorer countries to participate.
No priority simply for economic reasons.
We would in particular aim to retain more of those trained in the UK in the health service so that we have less need to take health service workers from countries that can ill afford to lose them.
We would also: Review the rules for those wishing to set up or do business here to ensure they are not discriminatory against smaller businesses.
Not simply accept people just because they are rich.
The London housing market in particular has been gravely distorted by the number of rich migrants buying property, bidding up prices all along the housing chain.
Ensure that no prospective immigrant is held in detention.
As a matter of urgency, the administrative detention of children and pregnant women should cease immediately.
Review the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, particularly with regard to issues of access to legal advice,
childcare and levels of subsistence allowance,
and reintroduce Legal Aid for reasonable levels of immigration and asylum work.
In addition, once immigrants have arrived, we would: Assist integration by making available free or affordable English or Welsh language lessons to all new immigrants who want them, costing about £200 million a year.
Open up ways for existing irregular migrants who have been here for three years to become legal.
In particular, a legal status must be provided for people who have not succeeded in their claim for humanitarian protection but who cannot be returned to their country of origin owing to the political situation there.
Ratify the International Labour Organization’s Convention on Domestic Workers.
Review asylum procedures to ensure that destitution plays no role in the asylum process by allowing those seeking sanctuary to work.
Ensure that those who have been trafficked are not subject to summary deportation; we must protect the victims of trafficking.
They should receive a temporary right to stay and have the same right to apply to remain as others seeking to migrate.
Trade, aid and grassroots development
People around the world have their own strategies and priorities for improving their lives and communities.
‘Development’ should not be directed by rich countries, which too often have their own business interests in mind.
Instead we need to provide the political space, democratic voice and appropriate resources to enable people in all countries to pursue their own chosen directions in ways that work for them.
International trade can benefit or harm the world’s people, depending on its nature.
Genuinely fair trade, alongside sustainable haulage practices, can bring benefits for all of us.
But ever-growing trade, over ever-growing distances and with the sole aim of making a profit can make life difficult for workers and is a sure-fire way of exceeding the limits of our finite planet.
Similarly, the world’s current structure of international institutions and trade rules can put less developed economies at a disadvantage, while making it easy for global corporations to buy up their land and resources.
We need to work with others around the world to reform and reinvent these institutions so that they facilitate greater global equality and justice.
The Green Party will: Advocate for ambitious sustainable development goals, including a commitment to end AIDS, TB and malaria;
action to eliminate violence against women and girls;
and practical measures to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality.
Take real action to end tax evasion and avoidance and transfer mispricing by transnational corporations, which steals resources especially from poorer countries.
Support global efforts to develop a fairer global tax system.
Put a stop to the corporate takeover of African food by ending UK funding of the G8’s New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition.
Promote fair trade, in particular seeking to ensure that workers in poor countries receive decent pay and conditions within International Labour Organization (ILO) standards.
Initiate democratic discussions, alongside international trade unions, citizen groups and the ILO, to investigate the potential for a global minimum wage to address in-work poverty and exploitation.
Ensure UK companies operating abroad respect international human rights and environmental standards
and do not encourage corruption, enforcing the UN Convention against Corruption and the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, and reporting fully upon their activities.
Ensure that every country has the political space to make its own democratic choices,
without pressure to prise open its economy for ‘free’ trade.
In particular, we oppose the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (see ‘The Green Party opposes the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership’ box).
Ensure that trade deals allow poor countries to control their economies; we will take the UK out of trade agreements that go against this.
Support the rights of indigenous people to control their own lands and resources.
The world has become a very unequal place.
Rich countries such as the UK have benefited from global flows of wealth while poorer countries and groups have tended to lose out.
Some transfers of resources from rich countries to poorer ones are therefore needed in order to redress the balance and allow poorer countries to improve living standards.
We will: Fight for the writing-off of international debts for the poorest countries and limiting repayments for other low-income countries, to ensure they can fund decent public services for their people.
Increase the overseas aid budget from 0.7% of GDP to 1.0% of GDP over the Parliament, costing around £6 billion a year in 2019.
Aid will not be tied, and will be distributed in ways that are focused on poverty eradication supporting grassroots initiatives,
women’s rights
and environmental sustainability
while respecting local priorities.
Help poorer countries to fund climate change adaptation and build resilient communities through the UN Adaptation Fund.
We recognise that the UK owes them a climate debt for our disproportionately high emissions and contributions to global pollution and climate damage.
The Green Party opposes the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)
TTIP is globalisation in its worst form, designed to submit democratically elected governments to the will of private corporations.
Companies will be able to take legal action against governments that they think threaten their profits.
National policies in EU countries for health, environmental, consumer and social protection could be challenged by companies from anywhere in the world in private international tribunals, run by corporate lawyers.
Under TTIP: Attempts to bring the National Health Service and the railways back into public ownership could be financially penalised or blocked;
Authorisations for genetically modified organisms may be accelerated at European level and risk assessment standards lowered;
and Regulation of banks and the financial industry would be harder, if not impossible.
CHAPTER 14
Imagine crime falling year on year because the causes of crime are being dealt with – unemployment, insecurity at home, school exclusions, inequality, mental health issues, drugs.
Imagine a prison population at the European average rather than way over it.
Picture prisons in public hands and actually rehabilitating prisoners.
Have you been a victim of crime?
Picture restorative justice, which gives you a voice and helps the offender to take responsibility and make amends.
It’s been said that, the more dysfunctional a society is, the more laws it has.
Here is how dysfunctional the UK has become:
Under Margaret Thatcher there were 1,724 new laws per year;
Under John Major there were 2,402 per year;
Under Tony Blair, 2,663 per year.
The UK imprisons more people than any other country in Europe.
Under the Coalition, the prison population reached an all-time high of 88,179 in December 2011,
and the number of front-line prison officers dropped by 30% between 2010 and 2013.
This is a picture of a very uneasy society.
The context of crime
Crime has a context: 60% of offenders have no qualifications at all;
48% have literacy skills below those expected of an 11 year old;
65% have numeracy skills below those expected of an 11 year old;
67% were unemployed at the time of imprisonment;
49% of prisoners ran away from home as a child;
41% were excluded from school;
71% suffer from two or more mental disorders;
70% of offenders had been drinking at the time the offences for which they were imprisoned were committed;
There is more crime in more unequal societies.
So: education, employment and security for all – this is the heart of Green Party crime policy.
We would: Treat drug addiction as a health issue (see Chapter 6 for our health policy).
Restrict police use of random stop and search powers, which damage police and youth relations.
Improve the design of our cities to provide safer streets and public spaces.
Focus on crime prevention measures, including more community policing under local democratic control, more local police stations and the return of bus conductors and others who have an important effect on social order.
Oppose the privatisation of policing and establish a Royal Commission on Policing as a first step towards delivering a service that’s fit for purpose.
Provide proper funding for Women’s Refuges for survivors of domestic violence
and make domestic abuse a specific criminal offence.
Work to change attitudes towards rape, including improving initial responses to women, early evidence collection and access to justice.
Abolish Police and Crime Commissioners, and return control of the police to local government.
Green London Assembly Member Jenny Jones saves Police Road Safety Unit
In 2009, Jenny fought the closure of the Metropolitan Police Commercial Vehicle Education Unit, which instructs HGV drivers on road sharing and awareness of vulnerable road users.
Restorative justice and offender rehabilitation
Once people have offended, what next?
Punishment for its own sake (retributive justice) gets us nowhere, and that’s why the Green Party would greatly expand the use of restorative justice, with the offender making up to the victim and the community.
This gives victims a voice and helps offenders to see the effects of what they have done.
This should enable us substantially to reduce the numbers in prison and reduce reoffending.
In particular, we believe there are far too many children in the penal system.
What happens when prisoners are returned to the community?
Nearly 50% of adult offenders released between April 2011 and March 2012 reoffended.
This is a real indictment of what happens to people in prison.
The Green Party would: Oppose the privatisation of the probation services.
Provide access to real work and education, the work to include repairing damage done by crime.
Provide access to artistic and creative facilities.
Provide access to literacy and numeracy classes from the first day of imprisonment.
Operate a smaller prison system, saving £5.5 billion over the course of the Parliament.
Grant prisoners the right to vote.
Oppose the use of the death penalty abroad.
Greens in power carry out our policies
Restorative justice works.
In Green-led Brighton, the number of young people entering the criminal justice system in the city fell over the three successive years to October 2013 as the Council’s youth crime prevention team joined with police to help young people understand the impact of their behaviour and make amends.
CHAPTER 15
It does all join up – One fine day in April 2019
You leave work at 5 pm on the dot, and check the bus stop’s electronic display – your bus home is due in 3 minutes.
It glides to a stop, electric motor whirring quietly, and you beep on with your smartcard.
The buses are not-for-profit now, and cheaper than they were four years ago.
You grab a seat and dig out your phone to check your bank balance because today is pay day!
You’re working as a cleaner at the hospital, so with the £9.60 minimum wage you get around £1,500 a month before tax.
The rent controls that were recently brought in mean you don’t pay too much to your landlord
and, since your home was super-insulated through the Green Warm Deal, your gas bill’s not much either.
With all that, you’re getting by pretty comfortably, and managing to save up a bit to buy a house.
The bus stops by your son’s nursery, where all the kids go free, and he comes tumbling out giggling.
Together you walk round the corner to your gran’s new council house for a cup of tea.
Her carer stays to chat for a few minutes before heading off to visit his next client.
He says that since social care is free now, and much better funded, he’s finding the work a lot more rewarding and might make a career of it.
Your gran is cheerful too, happy to be back on her feet after her recent stay in hospital, and glad the whole thing was noticed early and dealt with quickly so she can get on with her life.
Later, back at home, a child from down the road knocks on your door to ask if your daughter can play out at the park.
They are friends from school, the only two kids out of the 20 in their class who have packed lunches now that school dinners are free.
They head off to the park’s new play area, promising to pick up some milk at the Post Office on their way back.
You sit down at your laptop and start planning your next holiday, two weeks on the beach in Cornwall.
It’s a long trek, but the train tickets cost less than you expected and there’s a local line that gets you practically to the campsite gate....
CHAPTER 16
In 2010 the major election issue was the economy, and in particular the state of the public finances.
The Coalition parties pledged to close the deficit – the gap between government spending and government income.
They have not done so; the gap between spending and income in 2009 of 11% of GDP has narrowed, but was still 5% in 2014.
This is hardly surprising because the other parties’ election manifestos gave no costed plans for how they would reduce the deficit.
They made promises but gave no details.
We were treated to post-election surprises such as increased VAT and huge cuts to essential public services such as benefits, libraries, children’s centres and mental health support.
By contrast, the Green Party produced a worked-out financial plan in its 2010 manifesto.
Again in this manifesto, we are providing a costed plan for how we would protect and improve our NHS,
schools
and public services,
and pay for them with fairer, more progressive taxation.
We use current government data and show exactly how we would do things differently.
In this financial plan, we take no account of any extra money that could be available to government as a result of ‘Regaining control of our money’ (see the box in Chapter 9) – instead, these plans are based on the real-world current economic environment and on strict assumptions about the effects of changes.
Although it has not been our prime objective to end the current account deficit (that is, including expenditure other than investment) by the end of the Parliament, these plans show how we would do it.
After a brief note on territorial coverage, there are three sections – our basic economic assumptions, our plans for spending and our plans for taxation.
We conclude with the overall effect on government finances and on the gap between spending and income.
We are publishing separately an illustrative costing for Basic Income.
Note on territorial coverage
This is the manifesto of the Green Party of England and Wales. Separate sister Green parties cover Scotland and Northern Ireland. Many public services are devolved, with the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly or the Northern Ireland Assembly taking responsibility. However, most decisions on government expenditure and on taxation are ultimately taken on a UK basis, this is a UK general election and, despite the fact that this Green Party covers only England and Wales, and to maintain consistency and comparability, all the figures in this chapter are UK figures.
Economic assumptions
The most important assumption is what the government assumes about the growth of the economy.
If the economy grows, the revenues from taxation will be larger.
Both Labour and the Coalition made optimistic assumptions about growth in 2010.
We based our 2010 calculations on lower growth assumptions.
In the event, the economy barely grew in the middle of the period and, although we were less wrong than Labour or the Coalition, we were still some way out.
Many of the Coalition’s problems have their origin in this extraordinary optimism about growth.
The figures are as follows: The Coalition is once again assuming growth of around 12% over the Parliament, at around 2.5% each year.
We expect growth to slow a little over the Parliament.
The figures are:
Using these figures we can then work out our prediction for real GDP in each of the five years of the Parliament.
All our figures throughout this manifesto, for both spending and revenues, are in real 2015 terms. Our government spending figures are worked out as follows. We use the current government plans for real terms spending in 2015 as a baseline (that is, we repeat the same figure for each year), so we are not taking into account the Coalition’s overall plans to cut public spending up to 2018. We then express what we’d do differently in terms of how much we’d increase or reduce each item relative to this baseline figure. In most cases there is some phasing of expenditure, recognising in particular that our changes cannot realistically start with a full year’s spending in 2015.
Our additional expenditures include a line for changed interest on the national debt. Like the Coalition, we would fund the continuing deficit by borrowing. If we reduce the deficit more slowly than the Coalition’s plans, we would pay extra interest on the accumulated debt, and this line reflects that.
Our proposed savings are as follows:
