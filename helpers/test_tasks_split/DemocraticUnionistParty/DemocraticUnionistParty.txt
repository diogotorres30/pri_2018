Advocate an end to the present divisive community designation arrangements in the Assembly;
Seek to persuade others to end mandatory coalition government in Northern Ireland;
Campaign to cut the cost of government and reduce its size;
Work to maximise public confidence in the political institutions in Northern Ireland.
Support for Northern Ireland’s constitutional position within the United Kingdom has never been higher.
The number of people who want to see a united Ireland in either the short or the medium term is at an all time low.
The constitutional future of Northern Ireland has been settled for generations to come.
This has been achieved by agreeing political structures in Northern Ireland that can command crosscommunity support
and by ensuring everyone can play a full part in our society and community.
While we should never be complacent about what has been achieved,
the focus must now move to strengthen the United Kingdom as a whole
and to enhance our British identity in Northern Ireland.
Our place as a key and integral part of the United Kingdom has been highlighted in recent years by the decision to host the G8 at Lough Erne,
the visit of Her Majesty to Stormont in 2012
and the enormous role our people continue to play in the Armed Services.
Northern Ireland plays its full part alongside Scotland and Wales in intergovernmental relations within the United Kingdom
and every aspect of our government remains linked to Westminster.
Despite the opposition of Sinn Fein the work of the National Crime Agency is also being extended to Northern Ireland.
At Westminster our MPs have been at the forefront of the campaign for a referendum on the European Union
and in defence of our Armed Forces.
They continue to play a key and critical role in the decisions, which affect our nation as a whole.
We have built strong and solid relationships with both major Westminster parties to allow us to maximise our influence whatever the outcome of the general election.
In Northern Ireland we are working with other unionist parties to maximise unionist representation at Westminster and to deliver on the many areas of policy where we can find agreement.
While there is much we can do in Northern Ireland, some of these issues can only be delivered with the help of Westminster.
