We will help our families and communities to thrive
As a country we value compassion, tolerance and a sense of decency.
But pressures on family life, growing inequality, anxieties about crime and anti-social behaviour, and a widespread loss of trust in our governing institutions, are creating insecurity in many communities.
Labour believes a decent society grows out of family life and relationships, out of the work we do, and the local places to which we belong.
We will help to create a more secure and inclusive society by building and strengthening the institutions that help individuals, families and communities to thrive.
Supporting families and relationships
People’s relationships bind society together, and the family, in all its various shapes and sizes, is its bedrock.
But low pay, the pressures of work and caring for children and elderly relatives, have put families under increasing pressure.
We will help families by expanding free childcare from 15 to 25 hours per week for working parents of three and four-year-olds, paid for with an increase in the bank levy.
We will also introduce a legal guarantee for parents of primary school children to access wraparound childcare from 8am to 6pm through their local primary school.
As well as helping parents, this will provide children with before and after-school clubs and activities, helping to raise their aspirations and attainment.
This will be underpinned by a new National Primary Childcare Service, a not for profit organisation to promote the voluntary and charitable delivery of quality extracurricular activities.
Labour recognises the vital importance of the power of people’s relationships to build the capacity for love, care and resilience.
We will prioritise early years intervention to give children and parents the best start in family life, and restore the role of Sure Start centres as family hubs.
Sure Start will have an obligation to provide families with access to childcare, opening their facilities to charities and local childcare providers.
More widely, we will encourage local services to co-locate, so that they work together to shift from sticking plaster solutions to integrated early help.
We will take a whole-family approach to policy making, supporting relationships, and the involvement of fathers, grandparents and relatives in the care, education and health of children.
More fathers want to play an active role in their children’s lives and families want to spend more time together with a new baby.
So we will double the current two weeks of paternity leave to four weeks, and increase the amount of paternity pay from £140 to more than £260 a week.
Many grandparents want to be more involved in caring for their grandchildren, and we will support them in doing so.
As a result of this Government’s failures, the commitment to ending child poverty by 2020 is very unlikely to be met.
However, we will never forget how important a decent basic income is to a child’s prospects and wellbeing.
That is why we will keep the child poverty targets, and ask the Office for Budget Responsibility to monitor and report on progress.
We will promote the care and educational achievement of our most vulnerable children
and we will introduce mandatory reporting of child abuse.
We will increase support for children in kinship (family and friends) care and their families, a group too often overlooked and undervalued.
We will continue to support Frontline and its innovative approach to training social workers, and teachers will receive better training for working with children with special educational needs and disabilities.
Building new homes
Britain is in the midst of the biggest housing crisis in a generation, with the lowest levels of house building in peacetime since the 1920s.
Young people have been priced out of home ownership.
Fewer affordable homes are being built, homelessness is rising, and millions face insecurity and poor standards in the private rented sector.
Everyone should be able to live in a secure home, whether they rent or buy.
We will make sure that at least 200,000 homes a year get built by 2020 – almost double the current level – by implementing the recommendations of the Lyons Review.
It is only by building more homes that people’s aspiration for home ownership will be fulfilled.
Our comprehensive plan to tackle the housing crisis will give local communities new powers to provide the homes they need, in the places they want to live.
To help young people and families get on the housing ladder, we will give local authorities the power to give first call to first time buyers on new homes in areas of housing growth.
And we will unlock a Future Homes Fund by requiring that the billions of pounds saved in Help to Buy ISAs be invested in increasing housing supply.
We want a housing market that rewards the building of high quality homes rather than land banking and speculation.
So we will introduce greater transparency in the land market and give local authorities new ‘use it or lose it’ powers to encourage developers to build.
We will increase competition in the housebuilding industry by backing small builders, including through our Help to Build scheme,
and by getting the public sector building again.
We will build more affordable homes by prioritising capital investment for housing and by reforming the council house financing system.
We will give local authorities powers to reduce the number of empty homes, including higher council tax on long term empty properties.
And to boost the housing we need, we will start to build a new generation of garden cities.
For the 11 million people who rent privately, we will legislate to make three-year tenancies the norm, with a ceiling on excessive rent rises.
A ban on unfair letting agent fees will save renters over £600.
We will drive standards up by creating a national register of private landlords.
Homelessness is the ultimate symbol of the housing crisis.
Labour reduced homelessness by 70 per cent when we were last in office, but all forms of homelessness are back on the rise, with rough sleeping having increased by 55 per cent.
We are committed to reversing this trend by tackling the causes of homelessness and rough sleeping.
Restoring social security
Britain needs a responsible and fair social security system that provides security when people lose their jobs
or fall sick,
as well as a decent income when they retire.
The British people have always believed in the principle of contribution, rewarding those who pay in, helping people get back on their feet, and providing support in times of need.
To guarantee a decent social security system for the next generation, we need to keep costs under control.
Under this Government, the increase in low pay has left working families more reliant on tax credits and housing benefit, pushing up the social security bill.
To get the benefits bill under control, we need to tackle the root causes of rising spending, by making work pay and building more homes.
We will allow local authorities that negotiate rent reductions on behalf of tenants who are claiming housing benefit, to retain some of the savings, on the condition that the money is invested in building homes.
We will keep the household benefit cap and ask the Social Security Advisory Committee to examine if it should be lower in some areas.
And we will cap structural social security spending as part of each spending review, so that it is properly planned and controlled.
Labour believes in rewarding work and in restoring contribution to the heart of our system.
So we will not cut tax credits.
We want everyone who can to have the chance to contribute through paid work, so we will create a more tailored back-to-work system that helps people secure and keep jobs.
We will do more to help unemployed people get the skills they need for work, testing jobseekers’ Maths, English and IT skills within six weeks of them claiming benefits.
They will be required to take up training where this will improve their chances of getting a job.
We support the principle behind Universal Credit – that there should be a smooth transition into work – but it must be affordable and fit for purpose, so we will pause and review the programme.
There will be a guaranteed, paid job for all young people who have been out of work for one year,
and for all those over 25 years old and out of work for two years.
It will be a job that they have to take, or lose their benefits.
And we will commission a replacement for the Work Programme at a more local level, working with local authorities to join up support for the long-term unemployed.
We will introduce a higher rate of Job Seekers Allowance for those who have contributed over years.
It will be funded by extending the length of time people need to have worked to qualify.
Supporting disabled people to live independently
Alongside strong and responsive public services, the social security system plays an important role in supporting many disabled people to live independently, and must always treat sick and disabled people with dignity.
Half a million families have been hit by the Bedroom Tax, and two thirds of those affected are disabled, or have a disabled family member.
It is cruel, and we will abolish it.
We will reform the Work Capability Assessment and focus it on the support disabled people need to get into work.
We will give an independent scrutiny group of disabled people a central role in monitoring it.
And we will introduce a specialist support programme to ensure that disabled people who can work get more tailored help.
Older people
Older people deserve to live a fulfilling life, to continue working if they wish, and to enjoy a secure retirement.
Older people have contributed all their lives and built the Britain that the next generation  will inherit.
So it is right that they are supported with a fair and sustainable pensions system, responsive health services and a system of care over which they have control.
We will keep the triple-lock so that the state pension increases by inflation, earnings, or 2.5 per cent, whichever is highest.
And while increases in the state retirement age are necessary to keep our pensions system affordable, we will ensure that people have time to plan for changes.
We have taken the tough choice to restrict Winter Fuel Payments for the richest five per cent of pensioners,
but we will guarantee that there will be no additional changes to the Winter Fuel Payments, free TV licences or bus passes for pensioners.
Alongside a decent state pension, we must ensure private pensions are good value for those who have saved.
We will reform the pensions market so that pension providers put savers first, and protect consumers from retirement rip-offs.
We support greater flexibility for those drawing down their pension pots, but there must be proper guidance for people to avoid mis-selling.
Controlling immigration with fair rules
For our country to stay strong, with the confidence to look outwards rather than inwards, people need to feel secure in the strength of our borders,
our communities,
and in the workplace.
Britain has seen historically high levels of immigration in recent years, including low-skilled migration, which has given rise to public anxiety about its effects on wages, on our public services, and on our shared way of life.
Despite the Conservatives’ promise to reduce net migration to tens of thousands, it is now higher than it was when David Cameron entered Downing Street.
Broken promises erode trust.
Labour will never cut Britain off from the rest of the world.
Our economy and our society benefit from the talent and investment of people who come here, including university students coming to study.
But the system needs to be controlled and managed so that it is fair.
Low-skilled migration has been too high and needs to come down.
We need much stronger action to stop illegal immigration.
Labour’s plan starts with stronger borders
We will recruit an additional 1,000 borders staff, paid for by a small charge on non-visa visitors to the UK.
We will introduce stronger controls to prevent those who have committed serious crimes coming to Britain,
and to deport those who commit crimes while they are here.
We will introduce full exit checks, so that we can count people in and out of the country.
Short-term student visitor visas have dramatically increased, so we will tighten the system to prevent abuse,
whilst welcoming overseas university students who bring billions into Britain.
And we will keep the cap on workers from outside the EU.
We need fair rules at work to prevent the exploitation of migrant workers, which undercuts local wages and increases demand for further low-skilled migration.
Labour will introduce a new law to stop employers undercutting wages by exploiting workers.
We will ban recruitment agencies from hiring only from overseas
and crack down on rogue agencies by extending the remit of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority where there is evidence of abuse.
We need to strengthen our social integration and ensure that migrants can play their part in British society.
People working in public services, in public facing roles, will be required to speak English.
Those who come here will not be able to claim benefits for at least two years, and we will stop child benefit being sent to families living abroad.
We will enforce immigration rules humanely and effectively.
We will end the indefinite detention of people in the asylum and immigration system,
ending detention for pregnant women
and those who have been the victims of sexual abuse or trafficking
And we will ensure Britain continues its proud history of providing refuge for those fleeing persecution by upholding our international obligations,
including working with the UN to support vulnerable refugees from Syria.
Safer communities
Crime creates fear and insecurity.
We can only live happy and fulfilled lives if we know that we are safe, and that we are not at risk of violation of our person or property.
For too many people in our country that is not the reality they see in their communities.
Neighbourhood policing, the vital building block of British policing, is at risk of being destroyed.
Anti-social behaviour is too often tolerated, rather than dealt with.
Violent crimes have gone up, but fewer violent criminals are being caught.
Far too many victims of child sex abuse are being let down by the services that are supposed to keep them safe.
Labour believes British policing is at its best when it is rooted in local communities, proactively preventing crime, rather than simply reacting to emergencies.
We will protect neighbourhood policing.
By making different choices – to abolish Police and Crime Commissioners,
end the subsidy of firearms licenses,
and mandate police forces to work closer together
– we will be able to safeguard over 10,000 police officers for the next three years.
This will be backed up by a new statutory Local Policing Commitment, guaranteeing neighbourhood policing in every community.
We will strengthen community safety partnerships to give local people a role in setting priorities for neighbourhood policing and a say over the appointment of local police commanders.
To raise standards within policing, all police officers will be required to become Chartered Officers, holding a registration with the College of Policing, and able to be struck off for serious misconduct, just as doctors and lawyers can be.
A new Police Standards Authority will replace the discredited Independent Police Complaints Commission.
And we will work with the police to improve ethnic minority recruitment so that the police better reflect the communities they serve.
The next part of Labour’s plan is preventing crime occurring in the first place.
We will nip anti-social behaviour in the bud by making offenders put right the wrong they have done, with payback orders replacing low-level cautions.
And we will ensure staff who work with the public are given greater protection, with tougher penalties for those who assault them.
The last Labour Government’s reforms of youth justice, which required agencies to collaborate in preventing youth offending, reduced both youth crime and the numbers of young people in prison.
The next Labour Government will extend this model, piloting a new approach to 18 to 20-year-old offenders, incentivising local authorities, police and probation services to work together to identify those at risk of drifting into criminal activity and, where possible, divert them into a more constructive way of life.
And we will work to embed restorative justice right across the youth justice system.
We know drug addiction continues to be a major cause of crime.
We will ensure drug treatment services focus on the root causes of addiction,
with proper integration between health, police and local authorities in the commissioning of treatment.
And we will ban the sale and distribution of dangerous psychoactive substances, so called ‘legal highs’.
It is clear that we need a radical change in our approach to dealing with child abuse.
We will bring in tough new powers enabling the police to prevent an adult from contacting or communicating with a child if there is evidence of abuse,
and strengthen the vetting and barring regime.
A new child protection unit will be established to work across government, driving progress in the prevention of child abuse and sexual exploitation.
We need prisons that both punish and rehabilitate people.
Labour will do more to increase the amount of time prisoners spend working and learning.
Prisons will be measured by how successful they are in reforming prisoners and reducing their re-offending.
We will also raise professional standards amongst prison officers, including through the creation of Chartered Prison Officers,
and confront the neglected problem of staff corruption.
We will enact Britain’s first Victims’ Law to give victims of crime a voice and an entitlement to minimum standards of service from criminal justice agencies.
Ending violence against girls and women
Two women a week are killed by a current or former male partner.
At least 750,000 children a year witness domestic violence.
Stopping violence against women and girls is a priority for Labour.
We will publish a Violence against Women and Girls Bill,
appoint a commissioner to set minimum standards in tackling domestic and sexual violence,
and provide more stable central funding for women’s refuges and Rape Crisis Centres.
We will strengthen the law, banning the use of community resolutions as a response to domestic violence.
The gun licensing regime will be tightened, so that people with a history of domestic or sexual violence will not be given an unrestricted license.
And we will make changes to DNA retention, so that rape suspects have their DNA recorded and stored.
Victims of domestic violence need far better support.
So we will widen access to legal aid for victims of domestic violence.
Tackling the threat from extremism
The threat from Islamist extremism is increasing.
Hundreds of British citizens have joined Islamic State – a movement that has engaged in savage violence, and racial and religious hatred.
The British people have faced down terrorist threats before and will do so again, standing united together, not allowing ourselves to be divided.
With Labour, the security services will have the powers they need to disrupt and tackle terrorism.
The Government were wrong to weaken counter terror powers by scrapping Control Orders.
With Labour, dangerous suspects will be subject to proper controls.
Every government department will be engaged in the work of preventing extremism and fighting terrorism.
We will implement a much more rigorous strategy for dealing with people returning from the Syrian conflict.
Alongside appropriate police action and prosecution, it will be mandatory for anyone returning to engage in a de-radicalisation programme designed to confront them with the consequences of their actions.
We will need to update our investigative laws to keep up with changing technology, strengthening both the powers available, and the safeguards that protect people’s privacy.
This is why Labour argued for an independent review, currently being undertaken by David Anderson.
We will strengthen the oversight of our intelligence agencies to make sure the public can continue to have confidence in the vital work that they do to keep us safe.
To defeat the threats of Islamist terrorism, we must also engage with the personal, cultural and wider factors that turn young people to extremism.
The Prevent programme was set up under the last Labour Government to stop young people becoming radicalised.
But this Government has cut the funding and narrowed its focus.
Much of the work to engage Muslim communities has been lost.
We will overhaul the programme to involve communities in countering extremist propaganda,
stopping young people being groomed,
and also building resilient institutions for social integration.
We applaud those faith communities who have pioneered an inter-faith dialogue for the common good.
We will take a zero-tolerance approach to hate crime, such as anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.
We will challenge prejudice before it grows, whether in schools, universities or on social media.
And we will strengthen the law on disability, homophobic, and transphobic hate crime.
Arts and culture
Labour believes that art and culture gives form to our hopes and aspirations and defines our heritage as a nation.
The arts allow us to celebrate our common humanity in the creation and celebration of beauty. The arts should belong to all and be open to all to take part in.
We will guarantee a universal entitlement to a creative education so that every young person has access to cultural activity and the arts by strengthening creative education in schools and after-school clubs.
Institutions that receive arts funding will be required to open up their doors to young people,
and we will work with public bodies to rebalance arts funding across the country.
The last Labour Government made admission to our national museums and galleries free to all, leading to a major increase in the number of people experiencing our greatest cultural treasures.
We reaffirm our commitment to universal free admission to ensure that our great works of art and national heritage can be enjoyed in all parts of the country.
Creativity is the powerhouse of a prosperous economy.
It is the source of economic innovation and a powerful force in social renewal.
We will increase the number of apprenticeships in the creative industries.
We will create a Prime Minister’s Committee on the Arts, Culture and Creative Industries, with a membership drawn from all sectors and regions.
The Committee will bring issues of concern direct to the attention of the Prime Minister.
Sport
Sport brings us together in an expression of our local and national pride.
It is where young people learn about leadership, teamwork, the pursuit of excellence and strength of character.
With a Labour Government our children will participate in a minimum of two hours of organised sport every week at school.
Football clubs are an important part of many people’s identity and sense of belonging.
They are more than just businesses.
But despite their importance in the lives of their members and supporters, too often there are no effective means for fans to have a say in how their clubs are run.
Labour will provide the means for supporters to be a genuine part of their clubs.
We will introduce legislation to enable accredited supporters trusts to appoint and remove at least two of the directors of a football club and to purchase shares when the club changes hands.
We will also review the role of fan participation in other sports.
We will ensure the Premier League delivers on its promise to invest five per cent of its domestic and international television rights income into funding the grassroots.
Protecting our environment
We feel passionately about our local landscapes, our open spaces and wildlife.
Land and nature are part of our common home and inheritance, and they contribute to our sense of identity.
In a globalised world, our local environment provides us with a sense of place and belonging.
As we set out in more detail later on, a Labour Government will play a leading global role in tackling climate change.
However, it will not be enough to simply mitigate the threat of climate change.
We must adapt to its damaging effects, which are impacting on us today.
We will produce an ambitious adaptation programme,
and the new Infrastructure Commission will prioritise investment in flood prevention.
We will deal with the problems of air pollution by giving local authorities the powers they need, backed up by a national framework.
Labour has always believed that everyone should have access to nature, whoever they are, or wherever they live.
So we will keep our forests in public ownership
and promote access to green spaces in local planning.
We will support the work of the Natural Capital Committee to protect and improve wildlife habitats and green spaces, and make them an important part of our thriving tourism industry.
We will build on our strong record on animal welfare – starting with an end to the Government’s ineffective and cruel badger cull.
We will improve the protection of dogs and cats,
ban wild animals in circuses,
defend the hunting ban
and deal with wildlife crime associated with shooting.
We want to create a world-leading Food, Farm and Fisheries sector that creates better paid jobs and apprenticeships across the rural economy.
We will put in place a long-term strategy for the sector,
promote the best of British produce,
and expand the role of the supermarket watchdog to support the growth of the sector,
and protect food producers from unfair practices by the major supermarkets.
Labour will:
extend free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for working parents of three and four-year-olds,
and ensure all primary schools guarantee access to wraparound childcare from 8am to 6pm
double paternity leave from two to four weeks
and increase paternity pay by more than £100 a week
ensure at least 200,000 new homes a year are built by 2020,
with first priority for local first time buyers
provide security for renters by guaranteeing three-year tenancies
with a ceiling on excessive rent rises
introduce a compulsory jobs guarantee, paid for by a Bank Bonus Tax
abolish the Bedroom Tax
ensure migrants will not be able to claim benefits until they have lived here for at least two years
make it illegal for employers to undercut wages by exploiting workers
protect neighbourhood policing by safeguarding over 10,000 frontline police officers over the next three years
give football fans a voice in club boardrooms.
We will reform government to give more power to people
People who live in this country know that too much power is concentrated in too few hands.
Those who make decisions on behalf of others, whether they are in Westminster, the European Union, in business, the media, or the public sector, are too often unaccountable.
Our over-centralised system of government has prevented our nations, cities, county regions and towns from being able to take control and change things for themselves.
We will end a century of centralisation.
Labour believes meaningful and lasting change for the better is only possible when people are given the power to change things for themselves.
Our governing mission is to break out of the traditional top-down, 'Westminster knows best approach', and devolve power and decision-making to people and their local communities.
From the City of London to Silicon Valley the world’s best industries tend to be clustered geographically.
And too often economic challenges can be too, from our coalfields to some of our isolated seaside towns.
So a Labour government will unleash the potential of our city and county regions to drive economic growth and prosperity.
We will reform institutions and devolve power to deal with the causes of our economic problems,
and we will encourage local authorities to innovate to better serve their communities.
Instead of imposing change on communities, we will give them more control over schools, health care, policing, skills, housing and transport, making use of their insights into what works and what does not.
We will promote and encourage a model of citizenship based on participation and shared responsibility.
These measures are the start of big changes in how we govern ourselves as a union of nations.
They will begin to transform the relationship between the citizen and the state.
We will further develop digital government to enable better communication, more collaboration, and sharing of data between services.
It will make services and transactions more efficient and simpler for people to use.
To create a more connected society we will support making digital government more inclusive, transparent and accountable.
We will continue to back the principle of ‘open data by default’, releasing public sector performance data wherever possible.
A better politics
We will give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote by May 2016,
and improve the curriculum for citizenship education, so young people have the knowledge they need to play a full part in British society.
We will encourage young people’s volunteering and social action by supporting the #iwill campaign of ‘Step up to Serve’, and the National Citizens Service.
Drawing on the work of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, we will take steps to ensure that the move to individual electoral registration does not leave millions unregistered,
nor lead to constituencies that fail to take into account the people who live in them.
This will include block registration by universities and care homes,
extending Northern Ireland’s successful Schools Initiative,
and exploring the scope for an automatic system of registration.
Labour remains committed to reforming political party funding and taking the big money out of politics by capping individual donations to parties.
We will safeguard our democracy by repealing the Lobbying Act, which has gagged charities, and replace it with a tougher statutory register of lobbyists.
We will ban MPs from holding paid directorships and consultancies.
And we will reform the legislative process to strengthen the public’s voice and to better hold the government to account.
The United Kingdom
Labour believes in the historic union of our nations working together for the common good.
But as devolution has continued to gather pace, our union now needs to evolve.
As a priority, we will set up a people-led Constitutional Convention to directly address this and to drive political reform of Westminster.
Labour is committed to replacing the House of Lords with an elected Senate of the Nations and Regions,
to represent every part of the United Kingdom,
and to improve the democratic legitimacy of the second chamber.
It is also time to consider how English MPs can have a greater role in the scrutiny of legislation that only affects England.
This includes the option put forward by Sir William McKay, of a committee stage made up of English-only MPs.
These ideas must now be considered as part of the Constitutional Convention process.
England
We will embark on the biggest devolution of power to our English city and county regions in a hundred years with an English Devolution Act.
It will transfer £30 billion of funding to city and county regions, along with new powers over economic development, skills, employment, housing, and business support.
This will include control over local transport systems so that in future, local bodies can integrate trains, buses, trams and cycling into a single network.
We will enable city and county regions to retain 100 per cent of additional business rates raised from growth in their area.
Fair funding will be restored across England, alongside longer term multi-year budgets, so that local authorities can plan ahead on the basis of need in their area and protect vital services.
And an English Regional Cabinet Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, will be convened regularly, attended by the relevant Secretaries of State and leaders of our major city and county regions.
In return for greater devolution of funding and responsibility, we will establish local Public Accounts Committees, so that every pound spent by local bodies creates value for money for local taxpayers.
Devolution does not end at town halls.
Local people know best about the complex problems they face, and they are best placed to work out how to solve them.
The English New Deal begins the process of giving individuals and communities more power and control over how they are governed and over the design of their public services.
It will support people who need care to live independently,
help troubled families to turn their lives around,
and make sure that every child has a good start in life with early-years intervention and quality childcare.
We will give English people a stronger voice in shaping the future of their local NHS services.
Patients and the public will have a seat at the table from the very start of any process that draws up plans for change, including changes to hospital services.
We will give local communities more power to shape their high streets, and so preserve their local identities.
Councils will be given the power to require particular types of shops to apply for planning permission, allowing them to restrict the number of payday lenders or other shops that are clustering on a single high street.
Communities will be able to review betting shop licenses in their area and reduce the number of fixed-odds betting terminals in existing betting shops – or ban them entirely – in response to local concerns.
Scotland
In September 2014, people across Scotland voted overwhelmingly for change.
Labour will keep its vow and implement the Smith Agreement in full.
And we will go further, with a Home Rule Bill to give extra powers to Scotland over tax, welfare and jobs.
Rates of income tax will be set in Scotland.
Billions of pounds of social security spending will be devolved, including benefits that support disabled people
The Work Programme will also be devolved along with a greater ability to invest in capital projects.
The new devolution settlement will recognise the strength and security offered by being part of the United Kingdom.
We will maintain the Barnett formula,
and Scotland will continue to benefit from pooling and sharing resources across the UK.
Wales
Labour will put Welsh devolution on the same statutory basis as Scottish devolution, with a clear principle that powers are devolved unless specifically reserved,
and that a Welsh legislature is a permanent feature of our constitutional arrangements.
We will take forward proposals from the Silk Commission to extend the power the people of Wales have over their elections, transport and energy.
An all-Wales Policing Plan will give the Welsh people the ability to shape local policing in Wales.
Wales must not be unfairly disadvantaged by the Barnett formula.
So while the Conservatives have cut the Welsh budget by £1.5 billion, we will establish a fair funding settlement for Wales, with the guarantee of a funding floor.
Northern Ireland
Labour is proud of the role we played in bringing peace and stability to Northern Ireland through the Good Friday Agreement, and successive agreements.
A Labour Government will engage proactively with the Northern Ireland Executive to support continued political progress, and deliver on it’s vision of a shared future.
We will ensure the economic pact between the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive is focused on stimulating jobs and growth which contribute to reducing unemployment and poverty in Northern Ireland.
We will continue to work with the Irish Government to secure peace in Northern Ireland and strengthen relations between our two countries.
Rights and equality
The Labour Party has always led on challenging prejudice and discrimination and we will continue to do so.
People's differences are not excuses to treat them badly or unjustly.
The next Labour Government will go further in reducing discrimination against women,
requiring large companies to publish their gender pay gap
and strengthening the law against maternity discrimination.
Where there is evidence more progress is needed, we will enforce the relevant provisions within the Equality Act.
We want our Parliament to look more like Britain.
We are proud of our record in strengthening the representation of women,
ethnic minorities,
and other under-represented groups in politics and public life.
We remain committed to achieving a better balance in Parliament, including through the use of all-women shortlists in Labour Party parliamentary selection contests.
We will establish a comprehensive race equality strategy to break down the barriers still faced by black and minority ethnic communities.
Our aim is to make sure our national institutions, including Parliament, the police, judiciary, civil service, and the boardrooms of our companies, are more representative of our diverse country.
We will also build on our history of championing LGBT rights, tackling homophobia with tougher laws at home and greater engagement abroad.
Britain has a long tradition of liberty and the rule of law,
and Labour has a proud record of extending these to our most vulnerable citizens, by promoting equality and opportunity for all.
Thanks to the Human Rights Act, some of our most vulnerable citizens, including disabled people and victims of crime, have been given a powerful means of redress.
The Conservatives want to leave the European Convention of Human Rights, and abolish the Human Rights Act.
A Labour Government will stand up for citizens’ individual rights, protecting the Human Rights Act and reforming, rather than walking away from, the European Court of Human Rights.
And we will make sure that access to legal representation, a cornerstone of our democracy, is not determined by personal wealth, but remains available to those that need it.
Our Freedom of Information laws have shone a light into the darker corners of government and are a crucial check on the power of the Executive.
We will extend their scope so that public services run by large private companies are included.
And we will repair the damage done by this Government to the vital safeguard offered by judicial review.
The media
The free flow of information and of different points of view is crucial for open debate and countering concentrations of unaccountable power.
That is why the concentration of media power in too few hands is damaging to our democracy.
No one media owner should be able to exert undue influence on public opinion and policy makers.
No media company should have so much power that those who run it believe themselves above the rule of law.
Yet the current system for protecting against these threats is inadequate.
Labour will take steps to protect the principle of media plurality, so that no media outlet can get too big, including updating our rules for the 21st century media environment.
We remain strongly committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry.
We expect the industry to establish a mechanism for independent self-regulation, which delivers proper redress for individuals, as set out in the Royal Charter, and agreed by all parties in Parliament.
We made a promise to victims of the phone hacking scandal.
We stand by that promise and will keep it.
Our system of public service broadcasting is one of Britain’s great strengths.
The BBC makes a vital contribution to the richness of our cultural life,
and we will ensure that it continues to do so while delivering value for money.
We will also commit to keeping Channel 4 in public ownership,
so it continues to produce vital public content.
Labour will:
set up a people-led Constitutional Convention to determine the future of UK’s governance
replace the House of Lords with a Senate of the Nations and Regions
pass an English Devolution Act, handing £30 billion of resources and powers to our great English city and county regions
give new powers for communities to shape their high streets, including power over payday lenders and the number of fixed-odds betting terminals
meet our promises to devolve further powers to Scotland and Wales
give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote
create a statutory register of lobbyists
ban MPs from holding paid directorships and consultancies
require large companies to publish their gender pay gap
implement the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry.
We will stand up for Britain’s interests in Europe and the world
We live in turbulent times.
The rise of ISIL, an aggressive Russia threatening its neighbours in eastern Europe, and continuing economic uncertainty in the Eurozone, are each a challenge to our national security.
Labour is an internationalist party and believes Britain must engage with the global challenges we face, but not try and solve them on our own.
We believe the Conservatives are damaging the interests of our country by turning their backs on Europe, and isolating us abroad.
We will strengthen our national security,
stand up for human rights,
and work with other countries to tackle terrorism,
climate change,
and eliminate extreme poverty globally.
Britain has a unique influence in the world.
We are the only country that is a member of the UN Security Council, NATO, the G7, the G20, the Commonwealth and the EU.
With Labour, Britain’s response to threats to our security will be based on enduring principles.
We will protect our national interests, and strengthen our long-standing international alliances, in particular, our membership of NATO
and the European Union.
We will advance our international engagement, rather than retreating into isolation.
We will maintain the best Armed Forces in the world,
capable of responding to changing threats in an unpredictable security landscape.
And we will support human rights, always putting individual freedom and democracy at the heart of our foreign policy.
One of our first acts in government will be to conduct a wide-ranging review of Britain’s place in the world and how we can best uphold our values and the national interest.
Global challenges
We will take a multilateral approach to global challenges.
We will continue to uphold our key alliances.
These include the United States,
our allies in Africa and Latin America,
and our partners from across the Commonwealth.
They also include the European Union.
The crisis in Ukraine over the past year has demonstrated the importance of NATO and the EU standing up to external threats in Europe’s eastern, and southern neighbourhoods.
Labour will continue to advocate an EU which looks outward to promote stability, peace and prosperity on its borders.
Most immediately we will work with our allies to counter and confront terrorism.
ISIL’s barbarism and expansionist ideology, alongside terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and Al-Shabaab, represent a particular threat to global security.
Following a request from the Iraqi Prime Minister, it was right that the UK joined other nations in air strikes against ISIL targets in Iraq.
But military action alone will not defeat ISIL.
A long-term multinational political strategy, with regional actors playing a central role, is essential for tackling the rise of extremism across the region.
A Labour Government will always do what is necessary to defend our country.
Beyond self-defence, Labour has been clear about the need to learn the lessons of previous interventions, especially the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
We will continue the approach we have taken in this Parliament.
A Labour Government would not propose the use of military force without judging whether reasonable diplomatic efforts have been exhausted,
the action is proportionate and in partnership with allies,
whether there is a clear legal basis,
and if there is a clear plan, not just for winning the war but also for building a lasting peace.
Peace and security in the Middle East are one of Labour’s most important foreign policy objectives.
We remain committed to a comprehensive two-state solution – a secure Israel alongside a viable and independent state of Palestine.
There can be no military solution to this conflict and all sides must avoid taking action that would make peace harder to achieve.
Labour will continue to press for an immediate return to meaningful negotiations leading to a diplomatic resolution.
Labour will also continue to honour the UK’s commitment to support Afghanistan as it seeks to secure an inclusive and durable political settlement.
In December 2014, the NATO-led ISAF mission in Afghanistan ended.
We can never repay the debt owed to the brave servicemen and women who have sacrificed and risked their lives in Afghanistan to protect our national security.
As power and wealth continues to shift from West to East, our relationship with Asia will be fundamental to our long-term prosperity.
Labour will set up an Asia Step-Change Taskforce to ensure a more strategic and effective dialogue with regional partners, including China,
both in the commerical realm,
and in other areas, from cultural exchange  to human rights.
This commitment to universal human rights will be at the heart of our foreign policy across the world.
We will continue to promote women’s rights.
We will join with those campaigning to attain gender equality, the eradication of poverty and inclusive economic growth.
We will appoint a Global Envoy for Religious Freedom, and establish a multi-faith advisory council on religious freedom within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
And we will appoint an International LGBT Rights Envoy to promote respect for the human rights of LGBT people,
and work towards the decriminalisation of homosexuality worldwide.
Europe
Labour believes that our membership of the European Union is central to our prosperity and security.
It is why we will work to change the EU, so that it operates in the best interests of our country.
And it is why we will re-engage with our European allies to protect our national interest after five years of Britain being sidelined in Europe and isolated abroad.
The economic case for membership of the EU is overwhelming.
Over 3 million jobs in the UK are linked to trade with the European Union,
and almost half of our trade and foreign investment comes from the EU.
Competing in the single market, with the best companies in the world, drives competitiveness and innovation for firms in all parts of our economy.
And it helps boost the living standards of people across Britain, encouraging the inflow of capital and investment.
Our reforms will help deliver a Europe focused on jobs and growth, not simply more austerity and rising unemployment.
` Labour will focus on the completion of the single market and tougher budget discipline,
`including on those items where spending at the EU level can save money at the national level.
That means driving reform of the Common Agricultural Policy
`and a Commission-led zero-based review of spending on EU agencies to reduce waste and inefficiency.
`We will not join the Euro, and we will ensure EU rules protect the interests of non-Euro members.
`
A Labour Government helped to introduce sensible measures at EU level to protect the rights of British workers, and we remain committed to fighting to protect these measures.
`
People coming to Britain from the EU to look for work are expected to contribute to our economy, and to our society.
` So we will secure reforms to immigration
and social security rules, as well as pushing for stronger transitional controls, which will enable member states to manage the flow of workers for longer when new countries join.
We will also continue to open up EU decision-making, and implement institutional reforms to help build levels of trust among European citizens.
We will work to strengthen the influence national parliaments over European legislation, by arguing for a ‘red-card mechanism’ for member states, providing greater parliamentary scrutiny.
Labour’s priority in government will be protecting the NHS
and tackling the cost-of-living crisis.
It is not to take Britain out of Europe.
However, Labour will legislate for a lock that guarantees that there can be no transfer of powers from Britain to the European Union without the consent of the British public through an in/out referendum.
Defence and our Armed Forces
The primary duty of any government is the defence of the nation and its interests.
That is why Labour is committed to ensuring the UK has responsive, high-tech Armed Forces, with the capability to respond to emerging, interconnected threats, in an unpredictable security landscape.
We will conduct a Strategic Defence and Security Review in the first year of government, with an inclusive national debate on the security and defence challenges facing the country.
It will be fiscally responsible and strategically driven, focusing on the obstacles that impede our Armed Forces from effective response to threats.
At the heart of our defence policy are the service men and women, both regulars and reservists, who risk their lives for their country.
Labour will strengthen the covenant between our nation and our Armed Forces, veterans and their families.
We will create a Veterans’ Register to make certain our veterans receive proper support on leaving service.
We will continue to roll out Labour’s Veterans’ Interview Programme, in which companies voluntarily guarantee an interview for job-seeking ex-forces personnel.
We will introduce legislation to make discrimination against members of our Armed Forces illegal,
and we will enshrine the Military Covenant in the NHS Constitution.
The UK defence and security industry is a key contributor to our economy, with a turnover of £22 billion a year.
We will work to secure defence jobs across the UK,
protect the supply chain and support industry to grow Britain’s defence exports.
In partnership with industry, we will put accountability, value for money, interoperability and sustainability at the centre of defence procurement.
Britain needs to be prepared to counter the threat of cyber-attacks.
We have already called on the Government to require every company working with the Ministry of Defence, regardless of its size or the scale of its work, to sign up to a cyber-security charter.
This would reduce the risk of hackers using small suppliers to break into the systems of major defence companies or the department itself.
We will consult on creating a statutory requirement for all private companies, to report serious cyber-attacks threatening our national infrastructure.
Labour remains committed to a minimum, credible, independent nuclear capability, delivered through a Continuous At-Sea Deterrent.
We will actively work to increase momentum on global multilateral disarmament efforts and negotiations,
and look at further reductions in global stockpiles and the numbers of weapons.
Climate change
We will put climate change at the heart of our foreign policy.
As the terrible impact of the floods in Britain showed last year, climate change is now an issue of national, as well as global security.
From record droughts in California, to devastating typhoons in the Philippines, the world is already seeing the effects we once thought only future generations would experience.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made clear that if the world is going to hold warming below two degrees (the internationally-agreed goal), global emissions need to peak in around 2020, and then decline rapidly to reach net zero emissions by the second half of this century.
The weaker the action now, the more rapid and costly the reductions will need to be later.
The effects of climate change hit the poor, the hardest.
If we do not tackle climate change, millions of people will fall into poverty.
We will expand the role of the Department of International Development to mitigate the risks of a changing climate,
and support sustainable livelihoods for the world’s poorest people.
We want an ambitious agreement on climate change at the UNFCCC conference in Paris, in December.
We will make the case for ambitious emissions targets for all countries, strengthened every five years on the basis of a scientific assessment of the progress towards the below two degree goal.
And we will push for a goal of net zero global emissions in the second half of this century,
for transparent and universal rules for measuring, verifying and reporting emissions,
and for an equitable deal in which richer countries provide support to poorer nations in combatting climate change.
International development
We are proud that Labour MPs passed the historic law that commits Britain to spend 0.7 per cent of our gross national income on international development.
Labour will use that commitment from the British public to transform the lives of the world’s poorest people, whilst ensuring value for taxpayers’ money.
We will work in fragile and conflict-affected states to improve the lives of those affected by violence,
prioritising the protection and education of women and children.
We will rebalance the budget to focus funding on the world’s poorest countries.
While progress has been made towards the Millennium Development Goals, it is unacceptable that over a billion people still live on less than $1.25 a day.
We will work with other countries at this year’s Sustainable Development Goals Summit to unite the world to eradicate extreme poverty,
tackle growing economic inequality,
and place human rights at the heart of development.
We will establish a Centre for Universal Health Coverage to provide the support, encouragement, and global partnerships needed to help countries provide free healthcare.
We will lead efforts to reshape the UN humanitarian system to better equip it to save lives.
The private sector is essential to long-term development, and is often a positive force for change.
We will extend the sharing of tax information to developing countries, increase DFID’s help to governments to collect more of their own taxes,
tackle corruption,
and ensure good governance.
We will work with companies to ensure they have sustainable supply chains that are free from slavery, treat their workers fairly, and pay taxes where they are due.
Labour will:
conduct a Strategic Defence and Security Review in the first year of government
return Britain to a leadership role in Europe, but reform the EU so that it works for Britain
guarantee no powers will be transferred to Brussels without an in/out referendum
appoint an International LGBT Rights Envoy and a Global Envoy for Religious Freedom
outlaw discrimination against and abuse of members of the Armed Forces
enshrine the Military Covenant in the NHS Constitution
push for global targets to tackle inequality and promote human rights
establish a Centre for Universal Health Coverage
push for an ambitious target in Paris to get to goal of net zero global emissions in the second half of this century.
Time for change  In this election the country has a choice.
Either we can carry on as we are, with an economy that might work for some in the City of London but shuts out millions of people in the rest of the country.
A country in which young people are left facing a worse life than their parents and an NHS under huge strain faces a real threat to its future.
Or we can change direction, together, with Labour.
We don't promise the earth.
All our commitments in this manifesto are fully funded, so they can be delivered without a penny of borrowing.
But our policies will bring hope and make Britain work for working people once again.
Working people want an economy with better jobs and higher skills.
Families want to know they are guaranteed decent schools and good healthcare.
Mothers and fathers want a better future for their children.
Individuals and communities in every part of our country want to have control over their lives
and for those in power to be held to account.
Everyone, young and old, wants a sense of belonging and safety in their communities.
We deserve a country where everyone plays by the same rules, including those at the top.
That's what this manifesto offers.
It is the kind of country we know we have it in ourselves to be.
Let's build it together.
