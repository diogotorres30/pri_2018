We know here in Wales that our country is a fabulous place to holiday. From the stunning coastline to the scenic villages and the ancient monuments, there really is something for everyone. The challenge now is to get that message spread far and wide to tourists for whom Wales is not on the radar as a holiday destination. We could be generating much more money for our economy with more investment. Plaid Cymru want to make the most of our countryâ€™s natural beauty and show some real support to our tourist industry.
