All our figures throughout this manifesto, for both spending and revenues, are in real 2015 terms. Our government spending figures are worked out as follows. We use the current government plans for real terms spending in 2015 as a baseline (that is, we repeat the same figure for each year), so we are not taking into account the Coalition’s overall plans to cut public spending up to 2018. We then express what we’d do differently in terms of how much we’d increase or reduce each item relative to this baseline figure. In most cases there is some phasing of expenditure, recognising in particular that our changes cannot realistically start with a full year’s spending in 2015.
