Conclusion SO THIS IS OUR DETAILED PLAN FOR BRITAIN. Our plan to entrench the progress of the past five years. Our plan for you and your family, at every stage of your life. IT IS UNDERPINNED BY SOME SIMPLE CONSERVATIVE VALUES. Those who work hard and do the right thing must be rewarded. Everyone should be able to rise as high as their talents and effort will take them. We measure our success not just in how we show our strength abroad, but in how we care for the weakest and most vulnerable at home. ABOVE ALL, RUNNING THROUGH THIS PLAN  IS A TRUE BELIEF IN BRITAIN. In the past five years, as so often before in our history, we have once again defied the expectations of the world to rise up and meet our challenges. The British character is renewed every day by the millions who work hard, raise their families, care for those who need help, who do the right thing â€“ and make this country what it is. THIS MANIFESTO IS ABOUT IMPROVING THE LIVES  OF EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE. Together we have come so far. If we stick to our long-term plan, we can secure a better future for you and your family. So let us keep moving forward; and set our sights on making our great country greater still.
