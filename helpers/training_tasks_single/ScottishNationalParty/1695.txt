My vow is to make Scotland stronger at Westminster. At this election, we have the opportunity to shake up the out of touch Westminster system so that it serves Scotland better. A vote for the SNP on May 7th is a vote for MPs who will always stand up for Scotland's best interests. It is a vote to make Scotland's voice heard at Westminster more loudly than it has ever been heard before. And it is a vote for more progressive politics. The SNP will use our influence at Westminster to help deliver positive change for the benefit of ordinary people, not just in Scotland, but across the UK. We propose a real alternative to the pain of austerity, an end to unfair policies like the Bedroom Tax, a higher minimum wage and protection for our NHS and vital public services. Instead of even deeper Westminster spending cuts, we want to see more investment in our economy, to create more and better paid jobs. And we want the precious resources of our country to be invested in building a better future for our children, not on a new generation of nuclear weapons.The SNP will never put the Tories into power.Instead, if there is an antiTory majority after the election, we will offer to work with other parties to keep the Tories out.And we will then use our influence to demand that Labour delivers the real change that people want and need instead of just being a carbon copy of the Tories.A vote for the SNP will make Scotland's voice heard loudly and clearly.And it will help deliver new, better and more progressive politics at Westminster for everyone.My vow is to make Scotland stronger at Westminster. With your support, we can secure a better future for you, your family and Scotland.
