More problems are created by so-called ‘economies of scale’ where, in an attempt to emulate industry, common services have been merged into larger entities regardless of the nature of the variety of demand. Individual and local knowledge are lost and problems are dealt with according to protocols and pathways, not what is best for the patient. This has to change. The system must be designed around what the patient needs, not what Monitor (the sector regulator for health services in England) or the Care Quality Commission demand. Professionals must be given the time to care, rather than ticking governance boxes.
