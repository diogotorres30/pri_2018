The ‘human-centred’ approach also applies to NHS staff. The vast majority of NHS workers are highly committed, caring and careful individuals, but current systems often put them under stress and prevent them doing the right thing. We need a culture in which all staff are able to shape the system they work in and to openly share learning from mistakes and ‘near misses’. It should be a source of pride and joy, not fear and frustration, for those who work in it.
