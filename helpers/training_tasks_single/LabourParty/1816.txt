Foreword We are a great country. With great people. In the last five years I have heard your  stories, your hopes and your dreams. And I have heard too your frustrations.  The countless people working as hard as they possibly can and still struggling to  pay the bills. The young people with great ambitions but great anxieties about  the future. The dedicated staff of our NHS, who are deeply concerned about  its future. And all those who have served our country, are now retired, and ask  where our country is going. This manifesto is inspired by you. I take a simple view. We are a great country, but we can be even better The fundamental truth that runs through this manifesto is that Britain will only  succeed when working people succeed. It is an idea at the heart of my beliefs.  And it drives our better plan for a better future.  It means a country where hard work is rewarded, with high skill, high wage jobs.  An economy built on strong and secure foundations, where we balance the books.  It means building a future for all our young people, so they can get world-class  apprenticeships and access to affordable, higher education. It means strong  public services, rescuing our NHS.  It means strong communities, where power is shared by people in every part of  the country and where we respond to peopleâ€™s concerns about immigration, with  proper controls.  It means a Britain where everyone plays by the same rules, including those at the  very top of our society. And it means an outward looking country, engaged in the  world for our national interest. For me, the privilege of serving as Prime Minister in our country would be for one  purpose alone: to work every day to help build a country that works again for  working people. This manifesto is our plan to achieve that goal.  Ed Miliband
