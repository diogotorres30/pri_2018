â€œPeople across the British state are looking for an alternative to the broken Westminster system. Plaid Cymru wants to bring our government home to Wales so that we have the powers and levers to at least put us on a par with our neighbours. Wales must have the control over its own natural resources, criminal justice and policing system and our government must be made accountable to the people for the money it spends on their behalf. Wales must be treated as a nation and have the powers to act as a nation.
