Over £1 billion in welfare payments has been taken out of the Welsh economy since the beginning of the Tories’ cruel assault on vulnerable people in 2010. That’s money taken from the pockets of people trying to make ends meet. But it’s also had a knock on effect on local businesses and communities more generally. Plaid Cymru says that we, the people, have already paid enough for the greed of the bankers. They got a bail out. Payback for the people is well overdue.
