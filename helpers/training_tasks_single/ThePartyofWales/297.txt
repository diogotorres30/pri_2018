Our vision is to equip all our young people with the highest level of skills possible, whether in Further Education or Higher Education. This will be done by providing an education setting for all young people up to the age of 18. For Wales to be at its best, we need a world class education system that provides our people with the skills required for well-paid, high skilled jobs.
