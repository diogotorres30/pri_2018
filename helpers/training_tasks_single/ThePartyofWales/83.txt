Our workers should be given a decent day’s pay for an honest day’s work. It is unacceptable that 25% of workers in Wales are paid less than a Living Wage. If you work a forty hour week, you should earn enough to live on. That is why in this election we are committed to getting a living wage for all by 2020 - a pay rise for 250,000 Welsh employees. We want Wales to be a beacon of economic fairness.
